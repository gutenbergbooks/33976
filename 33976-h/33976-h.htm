<p class='line mb2ch center'><i>Graduation Night</i></p>
</div>

<p><span class='sc'>Jane Cameron</span> looked breathlessly around
the room where seventeen senior nurses of the
Good Samaritan hospital at University City
sat primly awaiting their diplomas. It was
graduation night and Jane was among the
seventeen who had completed all of the requirements
for a certificate in nurses&#8217; training.</p>

<p>Delayed half an hour by an emergency case
on third floor surgery, Jane had just slipped
into the room and taken the remaining chair
on the end of the line.</p>

<p>Dr. Albert Anthony, trim, energetic young
head of the staff, was speaking. Beside him
was the little white stack of diplomas, all of
them rolled and tied with blue and white ribbon.
Doctor Anthony&#8217;s sharp voice was informing
the student nurses that they were
about to embark on careers of their own. Jane
smiled a bit grimly.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_12'></a>12</span>She wondered just what career was ahead
of her. The girl next in line turned and a fleeting
suggestion of a smile hovered about her
lips. She was Sue Hawley, friend and companion
of Jane through the long, arduous
months of training.</p>

<p>&#8220;Here&#8217;s hoping he&#8217;ll tell us where we can
get jobs,&#8221; whispered Sue, the words so close-clipped
that it was almost impossible to detect
her lips moving.</p>

<p>Jane nodded. That was the one big problem
facing most of the girls who were graduating
from nurses&#8217; training at Good Samaritan.
As for herself, she had no idea what she would
be doing after the following noon when she
stepped through the doors of the great hospital.</p>

<p>Doctor Anthony finished his speech and the
nurses applauded politely. He picked up the
diplomas and called the roll of graduates. As
her name was called, each girl stepped forward,
her stiffly starched skirts swishing, and
received the tube of paper.</p>

<p>Queer shivers chased themselves up and
down Jane&#8217;s back. For three years she had
been working toward this moment and now
that it was at hand she suddenly felt cheated.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_13'></a>13</span>Perhaps it was because she was grasping so desperately
for something to do after she left the
hospital.</p>

<p>Sue&#8217;s name was called and she stepped forward
and received her diploma. Jane was the
last and she walked slowly toward the rostrum.
A mist clouded her eyes and her hand shook
as she accepted the diploma. It meant cutting
loose from the old routine, leaving the firmly
established and venturing out alone.</p>

<p>Jane wouldn&#8217;t have admitted, even to Sue,
that she was <i>scared</i>, for she was far too proud.</p>

<p>Then the program was over. Parents hastened
up to congratulate their daughters and
Jane and Sue drifted away from the others.
Their homes were in a neighboring state and
it had been too far for their own fathers and
mothers to make the trip.</p>

<p>Sue looked down at her diploma. She was
slender, blond, with sparkling blue eyes and
peach-bloom complexion.</p>

<p>&#8220;Wonder if I&#8217;ll ever have this framed?&#8221; she
sighed. &#8220;Right now I&#8217;ve just exactly $2 and
I&#8217;m not going to send an SOS home for money
unless I get down to my last penny.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve a little more,&#8221; confessed Jane, tucking
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_14'></a>14</span>a wisp of wavy, brown hair back under her
prim little cap. &#8220;To be exact, there&#8217;s $4.23
in my purse and I don&#8217;t want to ask the folks
at home for anything if I can help it.&#8221;</p>

<p>Jane was a bit taller than Sue and her brown
eyes matched the color of her hair. They had
stuck by each other through all of the tribulations
of nurses&#8217; training; now, though both
hesitated to mention it, each feared that graduation
would terminate their close companionship.</p>

<p>Miss Hardy, the supervisor of nurses, broke
away from another group and joined them.</p>

<p>&#8220;Drop in at my office before you go to the
dorm for the night,&#8221; she said. Before she could
explain what she wanted, an interne stepped
into the room and called her away on an
emergency case.</p>

<p>Rules had been lifted for graduation night
and a kindly theater manager, realizing how
little spending money most of the girls had, sent
up passes for his show.</p>

<p>Jane and Sue slipped out of the assembly
room, diplomas in hand. Hurrying to the
dormitory on fourth floor back, they changed
from their uniforms into street clothes and a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_15'></a>15</span>few minutes later were on their way down
town, the towering bulk of Good Samaritan
with its scores of shaded lights behind them.</p>

<p>The show proved entertaining and they
passed a pleasant two hours at the theater. On
their way home, Sue slackened her pace in
front of a drug store and looked longingly at
the gleaming soda fountain inside.</p>

<p>&#8220;Feel the urge of a chocolate soda?&#8221; asked
Jane, who knew her friend&#8217;s weakness.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s practically irresistible,&#8221; confessed Sue.</p>

<p>&#8220;Then let&#8217;s celebrate. The treat&#8217;s on me for
I&#8217;m at least two dollars richer than you.&#8221;</p>

<p>The sodas were delicious and the newly
graduated nurses sipped them in luxurious
leisure.</p>

<p>&#8220;My, but it&#8217;s going to seem good not to have
to jump every time a bell clangs,&#8221; said Sue.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know about that. I&#8217;m so used to
bells I&#8217;m afraid I&#8217;ll miss them just a little bit,&#8221;
Jane said.</p>

<p>&#8220;What do you suppose Miss Hardy wants?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Maybe it&#8217;s about a job.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t worry. If there was anything like
that in sight, she&#8217;d give it to one of her pets.
We&#8217;d never have a chance,&#8221; said Sue bitterly.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_16'></a>16</span>Jane and Sue had steadfastly refused to court
the favor of the supervisor of nurses and as a
result many unnecessary little tasks had been
heaped on their shoulders. It had been just
enough to arouse their determination, and they
had finished near the top of the class despite the
apparent prejudice of the supervisor.</p>

<p>It was nearly midnight when Jane and Sue
pushed open the double doors of Good Samaritan.
Only the night lights illumined the halls
and the strained quiet which pervades a hospital
at night had settled down over the building.</p>

<p>The elevator boy had left his post half an
hour before and they walked the four flights
of stairs to fourth floor back where the nurses
lived. Most of the girls were in the dormitory
and the hall was almost deserted as they neared
the office of the supervisor. The door was
closed and they knocked discreetly. An irritated,
tired voice bade them enter. Jane
opened the door.</p>

<p>Miss Hardy&#8217;s cold, blue eyes held little welcome
for her visitors as she peered up at them
through steel-rimmed spectacles.</p>

<p>&#8220;You asked us to stop here before we went
to bed,&#8221; Sue reminded her.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_17'></a>17</span>&#8220;Oh, yes. So I did. It&#8217;s a pity you couldn&#8217;t
have come in a little earlier.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It isn&#8217;t often that we have a night off and
passes to see a show,&#8221; replied Jane tartly.</p>

<p>Miss Hardy made no comment, but shuffled
through a pile of papers at one corner of her
desk. She selected a letter and scanned it
rapidly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Either one of you girls decided what you&#8217;ll
do when you leave tomorrow?&#8221; she asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;I haven&#8217;t been able to learn of a single job,&#8221;
said Jane, &#8220;and Sue has been no more successful.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then here is something that might interest
you.&#8221;</p>

<p>Miss Hardy tossed the letter across the desk.
Jane looked at the letterhead and her eyes
blurred. It bore the name of the personnel
manager of the Federated Airways.</p>

<div>
<a id='ch02'></a>
<p class='line mt3ch center'><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_18'></a>18</span><span class='sc'>Chapter Two</span></p>
<p class='line mb2ch center'><i>Opportunity Knocks</i></p>
</div>

<p><span class='sc'>The</span> pulses of the young nurses quickened
as they read the letter and they hardly heard
Miss Hardy saying, &#8220;Of course, I haven&#8217;t had
time to fully investigate this company and it
seems a little foolhardy for any young woman
of common sense to seek such work.&#8221;</p>

<p>That was typical of Miss Hardy. She was so
conservative that anything new seemed foolish.</p>

<p>Jane read the letter rapidly and Sue, looking
over her shoulder, kept pace with her. It was
from Hubert Speidel, personnel manager of
Federated Airways.</p>

<p>&#8220;My dear Miss Hardy,&#8221; the letter began.
&#8220;For some time Federated Airways has been
considering a plan to improve its service to
passengers and to provide even further for their
welfare and comfort while they are guests
aboard our transport planes. We have come
to the conclusion that the addition of a stewardess
to our flying crews is essential and at
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_19'></a>19</span>present we are contacting young women who
might be interested in this work. Our first
requirement is that the prospective stewardess
be a graduate nurse. Hence, this letter is directed
to you.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have consulted a number of eminent
physicians and they have highly recommended
the nurses&#8217; training school of Good Samaritan
hospital for the high calibre of young women
who are graduated. I will appreciate your
contacting any of the girls who might be interested
in joining our air line as stewardesses.
On your recommendation, we will provide
passage for them to come to Chicago where
they will undergo the necessary examinations.
Girls who weigh more than 120 pounds or who
are more than five feet four inches tall can not
be used.&#8221;</p>

<p>Sue looked expectantly at Jane when they
finished the letter.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, what do you think of that?&#8221; she
asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;I think it&#8217;s a great opportunity,&#8221; replied
Jane. &#8220;It&#8217;s a real chance to get into a new field
for girls. Air travel is developing rapidly and
perhaps we can grow with it.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_20'></a>20</span>Jane handed the letter back to Miss Hardy.</p>

<p>&#8220;It seems to me like a very dangerous type
of work,&#8221; the supervisor of nurses said.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t think it would be any more
dangerous than the everyday things we do.
I&#8217;ve noticed advertisements of the Federated
Airways. Their planes have flown thirty-five
million miles without a fatal injury to a passenger.
If I can go that far without getting
hurt very seriously, I&#8217;ll consider myself lucky.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ve always been lucky,&#8221; retorted Miss
Hardy, as a seldom-seen smile flickered over
her face.</p>

<p>&#8220;I guess both of you have thought me
pretty much of a tyrant,&#8221; she went on, removing
the spectacles and smoothing back her
straight, grey-streaked hair. &#8220;I&#8217;ll admit I&#8217;ve
been unnecessarily harsh with you on occasions,
but it was all a part of my system. Some
day you&#8217;ll thank me for it for you are the best
young nurses Good Samaritan has turned out
in many a year.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But, Miss Hardy,&#8221; protested Sue, &#8220;we
thought you had a grudge against us. Usually
we had all of the mean little things to do.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I know, but I was just testing the kind of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_21'></a>21</span>spirit you had. You came through fighting a
hundred per cent and even now, when I spoke
discouragingly of this possible work with the
air line, you showed your determination. I am
convinced that this is a real opportunity and
I should have been greatly disappointed if you
had not shown a keen interest in its possibilities.&#8221;</p>

<p>Miss Hardy&#8217;s eyes were twinkling and Jane
and Sue were astonished. Behind the hard,
outer shell of the martinet they had known
beamed now a very warm and friendly personality.
For the first time in three years they
felt they really knew Miss Hardy and each
was a little ashamed of the harsh things they had
said about the supervisor.</p>

<p>&#8220;Are you both interested in going to Chicago
and personally applying for positions with
the Federated system?&#8221; asked the supervisor.</p>

<p>Jane and Sue replied in unison and Miss
Hardy picked up the telephone directory and
after ascertaining the number of the local field
of the Federated line, dialed the airport.</p>

<p>The night operations manager answered and
Miss Hardy informed him that she had two
graduate nurses who needed transportation to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_22'></a>22</span>Chicago for an interview with the personnel
officer.</p>

<p>&#8220;When do you think we&#8217;ll go in?&#8221; Sue
whispered to the supervisor.</p>

<p>&#8220;That will depend on when there is space,&#8221;
replied Miss Hardy. &#8220;I expect that since you
will be traveling on passes it will be a day or
two.&#8221;</p>

<p>Sue thought of the small sum in cash she had
and wondered just how she would subsist in
Chicago if she failed to get the job as stewardess.</p>

<p>Miss Hardy jotted several notations on the
pad beside her phone, thanked the operations
manager, and looked up at the girls.</p>

<p>&#8220;The first plane eastbound for Chicago with
room for you will be through at three o&#8217;clock
this morning. That will get you there shortly
after seven. Can you get ready by that time?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We can be ready in half an hour,&#8221; gasped
Jane.</p>

<p>&#8220;I thought you could. That&#8217;s why I told
the operations manager to arrange for your
passage on the three o&#8217;clock plane.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll have to finish packing,&#8221; said Sue.</p>

<p>Miss Hardy looked at the clock.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s midnight now. If I were you I&#8217;d go to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_23'></a>23</span>the dorm and go to bed. Sleep until two
o&#8217;clock. I&#8217;ll come in and call you in plenty of
time to get dressed and get to the airport.
Don&#8217;t pack anything except what you&#8217;ll need
for a night or two. If you secure the positions
with Federated Airways, you can write to me
and I&#8217;ll have your things sent in.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s kind of you. Thanks so much,&#8221;
said Jane.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m just making up, a bit, for the grind I
put you through in the last three years. Now
get along to bed and don&#8217;t wake the rest of the
girls by talking. A couple of hours of sleep
will be the best for both of you. I&#8217;ll call you
in plenty of time.&#8221;</p>

<p>Jane and Sue left the supervisor&#8217;s office and
hurried down the hall.</p>

<p>&#8220;What do you think of it?&#8221; asked Sue.</p>

<p>&#8220;First of all, I think Miss Hardy&#8217;s an old
dear, and as for the chance to become a stewardess,
my vote is unanimous.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;So is mine, but I&#8217;ve never been up in a plane
before. I&#8217;m going to be just a little nervous.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve never been up, either,&#8221; confessed Jane,
&#8220;but it certainly won&#8217;t be any worse than riding
in an express elevator. Why, the pit just
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_24'></a>24</span>drops out of my stomach every time I get in
one of those things.&#8221;</p>

<p>They entered the dormitory and went
quickly to their own beds. They undressed in
the dark and hung their clothes in the lockers
which stood at the head of each bed.</p>

<p>Jane slipped between the cool, crisp sheets
and closed her eyes. But sleep did not come
readily. She was too tense, too excited at the
events of the last few minutes.</p>

<p>Earlier in the evening she had been wondering,
a little desperately, just what she would
do. Now there was a fair chance that she
would become one of the pioneers in this new
profession for girls. And Sue was going with
her. That was what made Jane supremely
happy. It would have been tragic to disrupt
the bonds of friendship that had grown so close
through the trying days of their training.</p>

<p>Then there was Miss Hardy. What a revelation
she had been. Jane smiled as she recalled
the friendly look in Miss Hardy&#8217;s eyes. After
all, the supervisor had been doing the best
thing for them even though many of the tasks
she had placed on their shoulders during training
had been extremely disagreeable.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_25'></a>25</span>Jane wondered what her father and mother
would say if she got the job in Chicago. It
might take more than a little diplomacy to win
them over to her side.</p>

<p>In the next bed, Sue was breathing regularly
and deeply and a little later Jane&#8217;s tensed
nerves relaxed and she slept. It seemed as
though she had been asleep for only a minute
when Miss Hardy shook her gently and whispered,
&#8220;It&#8217;s two o&#8217;clock and I have lunch ready
in my office.&#8221;</p>

<p>Sue was already dressing, and Jane hurried
into her clothes.</p>

<p>Jane had a pretty brown suit with beret to
match while Sue wore a two-piece dress of
heavy blue crepe. She had a spring coat of
similar material and a close-fitting toque, also
of blue crepe.</p>

<p>They tip-toed to the door of the dormitory
and looked back for just a moment. This had
been their home for three long years and there
was just a touch of heartache as they stepped
into the hall and Sue pulled the door shut.</p>

<p>Miss Hardy was waiting for them in her
office. Spread on top of her desk was an appetizing
lunch which the supervisor had prepared
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_26'></a>26</span>in the tiny kitchen which adjoined her
office. There was a large plate of sandwiches
and cups of hot chocolate.</p>

<p>&#8220;You shouldn&#8217;t have gone to all this
trouble,&#8221; protested Jane.</p>

<p>&#8220;It wasn&#8217;t any trouble. I wanted to do it for
I want you to have pleasant memories of Good
Samaritan.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re going to take away a very pleasant
memory of you,&#8221; promised Sue, as she finished
a sandwich.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have written my own recommendation
and a letter of introduction for you and I am
also enclosing Mr. Speidel&#8217;s letter,&#8221; said Miss
Hardy. &#8220;This should insure your seeing him
tomorrow morning in Chicago. I&#8217;ll be anxious
to know the outcome.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll telegraph,&#8221; promised Sue. Then,
remembering how little actual cash she had,
she added, &#8220;That is, we&#8217;ll try to telegraph
you.&#8221;</p>

<p>Miss Hardy smiled for she knew how little
money most of the girls had when they left
training school.</p>

<p>They finished the lunch just as the horn of
a taxicab squalled in the street below.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_27'></a>27</span>&#8220;There&#8217;s your cab. It&#8217;s a fifteen-minute ride
to the airport. You&#8217;ll have to hurry.&#8221;</p>

<p>Miss Hardy handed the letter of recommendation
to Jane, who folded it and placed it
in her purse. They hurried downstairs, the
girls carrying the small week-end bags with
them.</p>

<p>Miss Hardy walked to the cab with them.
Farewells were brief.</p>

<p>&#8220;I know you&#8217;ll both make good,&#8221; said Miss
Hardy. Then she turned and hurried back inside
the sheltering walls of Good Samaritan.</p>

<p>The cab lurched ahead, gaining speed rapidly
as the driver headed for the airport.</p>

<p>Jane and Sue settled back on the worn
leather cushions. In another half hour they
would be aboard an eastbound transport plane,
speeding toward Chicago. Their hospital days
were definitely behind them and new careers,
holding the promise of great adventure, were
ahead.</p>

<p class='line mb2ch center'><i>Adventure Ahead</i></p>
</div>

<p><span class='sc'>The</span> cab sped through the sleeping city. The
business district was soon left behind and the
paved road bordered the Wapsipinicon river,
which skirted the south edge of University
City. The road swung across the river and
ahead of them gleamed the red, green and white
lights which marked the boundary of the airport
of Federated Airways.</p>

<p>The taxi slowed and drew to a halt in front
of the administration building. The driver
helped Jane and Sue from the cab. Jane
opened her purse to pay the fare from her
slender funds, but the driver waved the money
away.</p>

<p>&#8220;Miss Hardy at the hospital said to charge
it to her account,&#8221; he said, and Jane and Sue
were given another glimpse of the warm heart
which beat beneath the grim exterior of the
supervisor of nurses.</p>

<p>The driver led them into the waiting room
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_29'></a>29</span>and left their bags there. Jane looked around.
It was her first visit to the administration building,
although she had been at the field a number
of times.</p>

<p>The waiting room was furnished with
modernistic wicker pieces. Soft tan drapes
were at the windows and a rug of tan and black
squares covered the floor. At a large table
in the center was a neat stack of magazines
while at a buffet along one wall was a silver
tea service.</p>

<p>The ticket office opened to the right and
Jane stepped up to the window. The night
manager looked up from his desk.</p>

<p>&#8220;We are the nurses from Good Samaritan
that Miss Hardy phoned about. We&#8217;re to go
out on the eastbound plane for Chicago,&#8221; she
explained.</p>

<p>The night manager swung around to his
ticket rack and made out the passes for their
transportation to Chicago. He was efficient
but pleasant.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll have to sign permits releasing the
system from liability in case of accident. Of
course this isn&#8217;t required from regular passengers,
but you are traveling free.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_30'></a>30</span>Both Jane and Sue signed the papers he
placed before them.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m making out round trip passes,&#8221; he said.
&#8220;In case you don&#8217;t get the jobs, you&#8217;ll be able
to get back here.&#8221;</p>

<p>Jane wasn&#8217;t sure there was much consolation
in that for there was probably more chance of
getting a job in Chicago than in University
City.</p>

<p>The night manager stepped into the dispatcher&#8217;s
office to inquire the position of the
eastbound plane.</p>

<p>&#8220;Your ship will be here in about nine
minutes. How about baggage?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We have small pieces,&#8221; replied Sue.</p>

<p>The baggage was weighed, checked and
placed on a small cart to be wheeled into the
hangar when the plane arrived.</p>

<p>The dispatcher stuck his head out of the
operations room.</p>

<p>&#8220;Charlie Fischer wants the flood light,&#8221; he
said.</p>

<p>Jane wondered who Charlie Fischer was and
just why he wanted the flood light, but to the
field manager that message appeared important
for he hurried into the hangar. A moment
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_31'></a>31</span>later a flood of blue light illuminated the field
and the drone of engines could be heard.</p>

<p>Lights flashed on in the hangar and Jane and
Sue left the waiting room. Two stars appeared
to be descending out of the west and the hulk
of a great tri-motor biplane drifted into the
brilliant light of the field.</p>

<p>The plane settled gently and rolled smoothly
along the crushed-rock runway. Its motors
boomed as the pilot swung it into the hangar.</p>

<p>Jane and Sue looked at the big ship apprehensively.
It didn&#8217;t seem possible that the three
motors could lift the great plane off the ground
and hurl it through the air at two miles a
minute.</p>

<p>The ground crew wheeled the portable steps
up to the cabin and the pilot and co-pilot came
down. They were young, clean-cut chaps.</p>

<p>The pilot hastened into the operations room
to obtain the latest reports on the weather between
University City and Chicago while the
co-pilot supervised the refueling.</p>

<p>Jane saw the baggage cart wheeled alongside
the plane and their bags disappeared into
the forward hold. Then the night manager
was at their side.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_32'></a>32</span>&#8220;You have seats eight and nine, which places
you together on the right side of the ship. This
way, please.&#8221;</p>

<p>The girls followed him across the concrete
floor and into the spacious cabin. Lights inside
were turned low for several of the passengers
were dozing.</p>

<p>Jane was amazed at the roomy interior.
Along the right side was a double row of comfortable
reclining chairs, very much like those
in a railroad coach. There was a single row
along the left side, with the aisle running the
length of the cabin. Overhead were baggage
racks for parcels and wearing apparel and there
were individual lights for each chair.</p>

<p>A shaded light in the bulkhead ahead revealed
two dials, one marked air speed and the
other altitude. A door led forward to the baggage
and pilot&#8217;s compartment while a door at
the rear opened onto a tiny pantry and a lavatory.</p>

<p>Jane counted the seats. There was room for
fourteen in the cabin and counting themselves,
twelve passengers were now aboard.</p>

<p>Chairs eight and nine were almost at the rear
of the cabin and Jane and Sue settled into the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_33'></a>33</span>seats. The night manager handed them each
a small, sealed envelope.</p>

<p>&#8220;Here&#8217;s your traveling packet of gum and
cotton. Better put the cotton in your ears.
The noise is a little bad the first few minutes.
If you think the altitude will affect your ears,
chew gum while you&#8217;re going up. Will you
want a blanket so you can sleep?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I should say not,&#8221; replied Sue. &#8220;I&#8217;m going
to see everything there is to see.&#8221;</p>

<p>The pilots re-entered the plane and walked
up the aisle to disappear through the forward
door. The cabin door was closed and made
fast and the three motors came to life with a
thundering roar. The big ship vibrated
strongly as one motor after the other was tested
until the chief pilot was sure they were ready
for the four-hour flight to Chicago.</p>

<p>The huge biplane moved slowly as the pilot
taxied it out of the hangar. Then the tail was
flipped around and the plane headed down the
long runway.</p>

<p>The night was shattered with the powerful
beat of the engines and blue tongues of flame
licked around the exhausts of the wing motors.</p>

<p>Sue, who was next to the window, reached
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_34'></a>34</span>over and gripped Jane&#8217;s hand. Both girls had
stuffed cotton in their ears and both were chewing
energetically on the gum.</p>

<p>With rapidly increasing speed the plane
rolled down the smooth runway. The ground
flashed by at an amazing speed and before either
Jane or Sue realized it, the transport was winging
its way over the edge of the field.</p>

<p>The flood light below came on, outlining the
entire airport with its penetrating brilliance.
The pilot banked the great biplane gently and
headed away into the east.</p>

<p>The roar of the motors filled the cabin but,
by leaning close, Jane and Sue were able to talk.</p>

<p>&#8220;Scared?&#8221; asked Jane.</p>

<p>&#8220;Not now, but my heart was in my mouth
when we started. How about you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I guess I felt the same way, but now it seems
as though flying was the most ordinary thing
in the world.&#8221;</p>

<p>The lights of University City faded and the
transport bored east into the night. Jane
watched the dials on the bulkhead. The indicator
for air speed pointed to 110 miles an
hour while the altimeter showed they were
now 1,200 feet above ground.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_35'></a>35</span>In a pocket at the rear of the chair ahead was
a folding map which showed the route of
Federated Airways from Chicago to the west
coast and Jane and Sue scanned this with intense
interest. Each city and emergency landing
field was marked, with a brief description
printed on the map.</p>

<div>

<p class='line mt3ch center'><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_36'></a>36</span><span class='sc'>Chapter Four</span></p>
<p class='line mb2ch center'><i>An Emergency Case</i></p>
</div>

<p><span class='sc'>Dawn</span> came as the tri-motor sped over the level
farm lands of Iowa. Passengers who had been
dozing roused themselves to watch the sun
shoot over the horizon.</p>

<p>The night mists were dispelled and the
fresh greenness of the corn belt in spring was
unfolded below them. Wisps of smoke rose
from the chimneys of farmhouses as breakfast
was prepared and Jane and Sue, looking
down, saw farmers about their chores in the
farmyards.</p>

<p>There was a brief pause at Bellevue for refueling
and then the big ship sped away on the
last leg of the flight to Chicago. In another
hour and a half Jane and Sue would be in the
Windy City.</p>

<p>An elderly man two seats ahead and on the
aisle had caught Jane&#8217;s attention and she
watched him closely. His face was pale and
he appeared slightly ill. Perhaps the motion of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_37'></a>37</span>the plane was unsettling, she thought. The
flight would be over in a short time.</p>

<p>Jane&#8217;s attention went back to the panorama
below and for several minutes she paid no attention
to the man ahead. When she looked
at him again, she felt genuine alarm and she
leaned close to Sue to speak.</p>

<p>&#8220;Unless I&#8217;m badly mistaken, the man two
seats ahead is mighty sick.&#8221;</p>

<p>Sue looked ahead and her eyes widened.</p>

<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s pale as a ghost. Can&#8217;t we do something?&#8221;
Jane nodded and rose from her chair.
It wasn&#8217;t any of her business, really, but there
might be something she could do. She stepped
forward and leaned down.</p>

<p>&#8220;You look ill,&#8221; she said. &#8220;I&#8217;m a trained
nurse. Is there anything I can do?&#8221;</p>

<p>The stricken man managed to smile and his
eyes spoke his thanks. Jane bent low so he
could speak directly into her ear.</p>

<p>&#8220;Appendicitis, I fear. I&#8217;ve had it before, but
never an attack as severe as this. How long
before we&#8217;ll be in Chicago?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not long,&#8221; replied Jane. &#8220;I&#8217;ll see if I can&#8217;t
find something to make you more comfortable.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_38'></a>38</span>Jane hastened back to Sue.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s appendicitis,&#8221; she said. &#8220;Let&#8217;s see if we
can find anything in the pantry to make into
a compress or fix up an ice bottle. That may
help check the inflammation until we get to
Chicago.&#8221;</p>

<p>While the other passengers looked on a little
startled, the girls went back to the pantry.</p>

<p>&#8220;Here&#8217;s a bottle of cold water,&#8221; said Sue.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve found some towels. We&#8217;ll make some
cold compresses.&#8221;</p>

<p>Some one tapped her on the shoulder just
then and she turned around to look into the
stern face of the co-pilot.</p>

<p>&#8220;Passengers are not allowed here,&#8221; he said.
&#8220;You&#8217;ll have to go back to your seats.&#8221;</p>

<p>Sue started to make a sharp reply, but Jane
silenced her.</p>

<p>&#8220;The man in No. 4 is suffering from an attack
of appendicitis,&#8221; she explained. &#8220;We&#8217;re
trained nurses and thought we might find something
here we could use to relieve the pain until
we get to Chicago.&#8221;</p>

<p>The grim expression on the co-pilot&#8217;s face
vanished.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why didn&#8217;t you say so?&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_39'></a>39</span>&#8220;You didn&#8217;t give us a chance,&#8221; retorted Sue.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you think his condition is serious?&#8221; the
flyer asked Jane.</p>

<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s pretty sick right now and he&#8217;s not a
young man by any means. If you can send
word ahead some way to have an ambulance
waiting at the field, that will help.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll get a radio off at once. Is there anything
I can do?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, we&#8217;ll do everything possible,&#8221; Jane
told him.</p>

<p>&#8220;The other passengers seem to be a little
alarmed,&#8221; said Sue. &#8220;I&#8217;m going to tell them
just what&#8217;s up.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Good idea. I&#8217;ll have the compresses ready
when you come back.&#8221;</p>

<p>Sue went along the cabin and stopped to tell
each passenger just what was the matter with
the elderly man in No. 4. Everyone was
sympathetic, but there was nothing they could
do to help.</p>

<p>The girls made the stricken man as comfortable
as possible and changed the cold packs
frequently. It seemed to Jane as though the
engines were droning along at a higher pitch
and a glance at the air-speed indicator revealed
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_40'></a>40</span>that they were traveling 135 miles an hour.</p>

<p>They passed over Aurora and Jane knew
they would soon be in Chicago. The co-pilot
came back.</p>

<p>&#8220;How&#8217;s he getting along?&#8221; he asked Jane.</p>

<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s much more comfortable. Did you
get a message through?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;An ambulance is waiting at the field right
now. Gosh, but I&#8217;m glad you girls were along.
You ought to apply for jobs with the company.
They&#8217;re going to put on a bunch of girls as
stewardesses.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s just exactly why we&#8217;re on this
plane.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then this bit of first aid won&#8217;t hurt you in
getting a job,&#8221; grinned the co-pilot.</p>

<p>He ducked back into the forward compartment
and a few minutes later the plane swung
over the municipal airport, Chicago headquarters
of the Federated Airways.</p>

<p>Word had been flashed around the field that
the incoming plane was bringing in a sick man,
and the ship was given the right of way over all
other planes.</p>

<p>Jane and Sue were too much interested in
their patient to feel the slightest discomfort as
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_41'></a>41</span>the plane landed and rolled along the concrete
ramp.</p>

<p>Sue hurried the other passengers out and an
ambulance backed up to the plane.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m deeply grateful,&#8221; whispered their
patient, as he was lifted from the plane to the
ambulance.</p>

<p>A white-garbed interne waved to the driver
and with its siren clearing a path, the ambulance
sped away.</p>

<p>Jane smiled at her companion.</p>

<p>&#8220;I wonder who he was? I forgot to ask his
name.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I was too busy to think about that,&#8221; confessed
Sue. &#8220;Perhaps we&#8217;ll see him again if we
are fortunate enough to secure positions on the
air line.&#8221;</p>

<p>The chief pilot of their plane paused beside
them.</p>

<p>&#8220;That was fine, level-headed work,&#8221; he said.
&#8220;You girls did exactly the right thing. I&#8217;m
mighty glad the line is going to add a trained
nurse as stewardess on all of the passenger runs.
The co-pilot said you were going to apply.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We hope to see Mr. Speidel, the personnel
director, today,&#8221; said Jane.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_42'></a>42</span>The chief pilot glanced at his wrist watch.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s just seven-thirty. Mr. Speidel won&#8217;t be
here for another hour. Tell you what. Let&#8217;s
have breakfast together here at the field and
then I&#8217;ll see that you have an interview with
Mr. Speidel as soon as he reaches the field.
Believe me, I&#8217;m grateful for what you girls did
on the flight in.&#8221;</p>

<p>Jane hesitated a second, but Sue accepted enthusiastically.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s fine. I&#8217;ve got to see that the ship
is berthed properly. I&#8217;ll meet you in the waiting
room.&#8221;</p>

<p>The lanky flyer hurried away and Jane and
Sue went into the waiting room.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you think we ought to have accepted
the invitation?&#8221; asked Jane.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes. If we get on as stewardesses, we&#8217;ll
have to know all of the pilots fairly well. Besides,
think what a free breakfast means to our
slender purses.&#8221;</p>

<p>Jane smiled. &#8220;You would think of that.&#8221;</p>

<p>A few minutes later the pilot of their ship
rejoined them.</p>

<p>&#8220;Say, I forgot to introduce myself,&#8221; he
chuckled. &#8220;I&#8217;m Charlie Fischer.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_43'></a>43</span>&#8220;And I&#8217;m Jane Cameron and my friend is
Sue Hawley.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Now that everything&#8217;s in order and we
know who&#8217;s who, let&#8217;s eat.&#8221;</p>

<p>The flyer led the way into the modernistic
restaurant which adjoined the waiting room
and they sat down at gleaming black and silver
tables.</p>

<p>&#8220;The sky&#8217;s the limit,&#8221; advised their new
friend and Jane and Sue added bacon to their
usual breakfast of toast and fruit.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you know very much about the plans
for using stewardesses?&#8221; asked Jane.</p>

<p>&#8220;Only the talk that&#8217;s heard along the system.
With passenger traffic getting heavier all of
the time, some step must be taken to have a
member of the crew in the cabin where the
needs of the passengers can be looked after. I
think selecting trained nurses is a mighty good
idea.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Have any girls been hired?&#8221; Sue wanted to
know.</p>

<p>&#8220;Not yet. I think today is the first on which
Mr. Speidel is to have interviews with candidates.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Is he nice?&#8221; persisted Sue.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_44'></a>44</span>&#8220;He&#8217;s not half bad and I&#8217;m certainly going
to give both of you the best possible recommendation.
Have either of you flown much
before?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;This was our first trip,&#8221; said Jane.</p>

<p>Charlie Fischer whistled softly. &#8220;Well, you
certainly are a cool pair. I hope you&#8217;re assigned
to my crew.&#8221;</p>

<p>They finished breakfast and the chief pilot
walked with them to the near-by administration
building.</p>

<p>The field was roaring with activity. Planes
were at the ramp being loaded with mail and
express, ready for swift dashes to almost every
point of the compass. Passengers were saying
hasty farewells to friends, and porters, laden
with baggage, hurried from taxis to the planes.
It was a fascinating picture and Jane knew that
she would thoroughly enjoy being a part of it.</p>

<p class='line mb2ch center'><i>With Flying Colors</i></p>
</div>

<p><span class='sc'>Charlie Fischer</span> took Jane and Sue up to the
second floor of the administration building.
They entered a broad hall with chairs ranged
along each wall and in every chair was a girl.</p>

<p>Jane&#8217;s heart sank for she knew instantly that
every one of them was there to apply for the
position of stewardess. Sue looked at her and
somehow managed a brave smile.</p>

<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s going to be plenty of competition,&#8221;
she whispered.</p>

<p>Charlie Fischer glanced at the double row
of girls waiting to be called into the office of
the personnel director.</p>

<p>&#8220;Wait here,&#8221; he told Jane and Sue. &#8220;I&#8217;ll see
if we can&#8217;t manage to slip through ahead of the
rest.&#8221;</p>

<p>Jane and Sue sat down in the last two chairs
along the hall and Jane looked at their competitors.
The girls were all about her own age,
most of them very attractive to look upon.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_46'></a>46</span>They were trim and capable and had the calm
bearing which their training had instilled.</p>

<p>A secretary came down the hall, taking the
names and addresses of each girl. Finally she
reached Jane and Sue and they gave their
names.</p>

<p>&#8220;What is your Chicago address?&#8221; she asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;We just arrived,&#8221; explained Jane, &#8220;and
hope to see Mr. Speidel this morning.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m afraid you won&#8217;t be able to see him
today. There are all those girls ahead of you,&#8221;
the secretary advised.</p>

<p>Jane&#8217;s spirits ebbed but she went on determinedly.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have a letter here from the supervisor of
nurses at Good Samaritan hospital at University
City,&#8221; she said. &#8220;Mr. Speidel wrote to
her asking that she recommend several girls for
this work.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, I know. Mr. Speidel wrote to a
number of supervisors. Almost every girl here
has her recommendation from a supervisor,
but I&#8217;m afraid you&#8217;ll have to wait your turn.&#8221;</p>

<p>The secretary returned to her desk at the
head of the hall and several minutes later the
first two girls at the head of the line were called
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_47'></a>47</span>into the office of the personnel director.</p>

<p>&#8220;Looks like our flying friend has forgotten
all about us,&#8221; said Sue when half an hour had
elapsed and there was no sign of Charlie
Fischer.</p>

<p>Jane nodded a bit dismally.</p>

<p>Slowly the girls were called into the office
and Jane knew that there was little chance she
and Sue would have an interview that day.</p>

<p>It was nearly an hour later when Charlie
Fischer reappeared and instead of coming out
of the personnel director&#8217;s office, he came up
the stairs which led to the ramp. In his hand
was a typed report.</p>

<p>&#8220;Think I&#8217;d forgotten all about you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We had almost given up hope,&#8221; conceded
Jane.</p>

<p>&#8220;I had quite an argument with Mr. Speidel
about seeing you girls out of turn. He&#8217;s a
stickler for detail and fair play and is afraid
that if you are taken in ahead of the others they
may feel he is playing favorites.&#8221;</p>

<p>Jane nodded. She could understand that and
she didn&#8217;t want to start work, if they secured
the positions, under a handicap of resentment
by the other girls.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_48'></a>48</span>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t argue long enough to make him
mad,&#8221; said the flyer, &#8220;but skipped out the back
way and went down to get a complete report
on our flight in. I also checked the hospital to
find out about your patient. He&#8217;s getting
along fine, thanks to the emergency treatment
you were able to give him. Now I&#8217;m going
to hand these reports in and we&#8217;ll see what happens.&#8221;</p>

<p>The lanky flyer hurried down the hall and
went into the personnel director&#8217;s office. In
less than five minutes he opened the door and
beckoned for Jane and Sue to join him.</p>

<p>The young nurses smoothed their dresses
and gave their hair a final pat as they hurried
down the hall.</p>

<p>The office of the personnel director was large
and, like the entire administration building of
Federated Airways, was furnished in a modernistic
style. One whole wall was of glass, giving
a wonderful view of the entire field.</p>

<p>The personnel director looked up from the
typed report he had been scanning. He was
short and stocky, with dark, close-cropped
hair and a heavy face, but his eyes were pleasant
and he greeted them warmly.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_49'></a>49</span>&#8220;I&#8217;ve just finished reading the complete report
of the fine piece of work you did coming
in on trip No. 6 this morning. Charlie tells
me neither of you had flown before.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It was our first trip,&#8221; admitted Jane.</p>

<p>&#8220;Then I must say you were remarkably
cool-headed under the circumstances. Do you
have a letter from your supervisor?&#8221;</p>

<p>Jane handed him the envelope from Miss
Hardy and he read the letter of commendation
thoroughly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Your supervisor thinks rather highly of
you,&#8221; smiled Mr. Speidel when he finished.
&#8220;Do you really think you&#8217;d like flying?&#8221;</p>

<p>He shot the question at them unexpectedly.</p>

<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s danger, there&#8217;s a lot of responsibility,
and there&#8217;s a great deal of work at
times,&#8221; he went on. &#8220;You may be trapped in
almost any kind of weather&mdash;rain, snow, hail,
sleet, fog. You must be calm and resourceful
and courageous. We demand a great deal of
loyalty.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve thought the whole thing over,&#8221; said
Sue, &#8220;and decided we&#8217;d like the work. Now,
after the trip in from University City, we are
certain we are making no mistake.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_50'></a>50</span>&#8220;How about you, Miss Cameron?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am sure I would like it,&#8221; said Jane.</p>

<p>&#8220;Very well. We&#8217;ll put you down on the
tentatively accepted list. Final acceptance will
depend on your ability to qualify under our
physical requirements. You&#8217;ll find the office
of Dr. Emma Perkins at the other end of the
hall. Give her this card and she&#8217;ll put you
through the routine. If you pass, return here at
three o&#8217;clock.&#8221; When they emerged from the
office of the personnel director, a little breathless
and flushed, it was nearly lunch time.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d like to treat you to lunch,&#8221; said Charlie
Fischer, &#8220;but I&#8217;ve got to get down town.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Thanks a lot for all you&#8217;ve done,&#8221; said Jane.
&#8220;We&#8217;ll do our best to pass the rest of the examinations.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll come out all right,&#8221; prophesied their
new friend.</p>

<p>Jane and Sue went down to the restaurant
on the main floor where they ate a leisurely
lunch. Outside planes were landing and taking
off and a constant crowd swirled along the
ramp and through the waiting room.</p>

<p>Already the tempo of the whole thing had
gotten deep into their blood.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_51'></a>51</span>&#8220;I&#8217;ll be terribly disappointed if we don&#8217;t pass
the physical tests,&#8221; confessed Sue.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t worry about that. We&#8217;re in perfect
health.&#8221;</p>

<p>At one o&#8217;clock they reported at the office of
Dr. Perkins and were taken into the examination
room at once. Doctor Perkins, small and
business-like, put them through the regular
routine.</p>

<p>&#8220;Humph,&#8221; she said as she checked the results.
&#8220;If all girls were as healthy as you two,
there would be little for doctors to do.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then you mean we&#8217;ve passed all right?&#8221;
asked Sue anxiously.</p>

<p>&#8220;Your physical report will be 96 per cent,
which is unusually high. Take your cards back
to Mr. Speidel&#8217;s office.&#8221;</p>

<p>When Sue and Jane returned to the other
end of the hall the line of girls had thinned.
They presented their health cards to the secretary
and were admitted almost at once to the
office.</p>

<p>&#8220;It looks like I&#8217;m about to sign two more
stewardesses,&#8221; he smiled as he took their cards.
His eyes widened as he read the final report.
&#8220;Why, this is rather remarkable. Doctor Perkins
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_52'></a>52</span>is pretty much of a stickler for detail. A
96 mark from her is about 99 from any other
examiner.&#8221;</p>

<p>The personnel officer took two blanks from
a pile at one corner of his desk.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now we&#8217;ll get down to the serious business
of enrolling you for the stewardess service,&#8221; he
said.</p>

<p>&#8220;You mean we&#8217;ve really got the jobs?&#8221; asked
Jane.</p>

<p>&#8220;You certainly have. Your pay starts today
with a salary of $125 a month and uniforms
furnished by the system. Does that sound attractive?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s more than attractive,&#8221; smiled Sue.</p>

<p>In less than ten minutes they were formally
enrolled as members of the Federated Airways&#8217;
stewardess service.</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve signed a dozen girls, including you
two, and are sending them all west to Cheyenne
tonight aboard a special plane. Uniforms are
being made here. Take a company taxi and go
to the Barclay Tailors on North Michigan Avenue.
They are outfitting all of the girls. Be
back at the field at five o&#8217;clock. Miss Comstock,
who is chief of the stewardess service,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_53'></a>53</span>will be here. Report to her at this office.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Thank you very much, Mr. Speidel,&#8221; said
Jane.</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll do our best,&#8221; promised Sue.</p>

<p>They were in a cab and speeding toward
the loop before they relaxed, for the strain of
the last few hours had been terrific for both
girls.</p>

<p>Sue&#8217;s eyes filled with tears and Jane felt her
own throat choke up. With their funds so
low, securing the positions with the Federated
Airways had been essential and now that it was
no longer a dream, it was hard to believe.</p>

<p>&#8220;Would you mind pinching me to see if I
am awake?&#8221; said Sue, dabbing at her eyes with
a handkerchief.</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re awake all right,&#8221; said Jane as the cab
struck a bad bump and threw them to the ceiling.
The meter was clicking up an astonishing
taxi bill and Sue stared at it questioningly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Maybe we&#8217;d better get out and take a street
car down town,&#8221; she suggested.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t be silly. This is a Federated Airways
cab. It won&#8217;t cost us a cent and the driver
will come around and take us back to the field
when we&#8217;re ready.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_54'></a>54</span>&#8220;How do you know?&#8221; Sue asked suspiciously.</p>

<p>&#8220;Because I took the time and had the good
sense to inquire at the ticket office. When I
told them we were new stewardesses they gave
me a card entitling us to round-trip transportation
to the loop in a company cab.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t see you do that,&#8221; protested Sue.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, you were too busy watching the plane
coming in from the west.&#8221;</p>

<p>At the tailors they were measured for trim
serge suits of a smoke-green. Berets of the
same material and color were furnished.</p>

<p>The fitting required an hour and the tailors
promised to have the suits in Cheyenne within
the week.</p>

<p>&#8220;What do you think of the uniforms?&#8221; Jane
asked as they left the tailors.</p>

<p>&#8220;I love them. They&#8217;re so trim and business-like,
yet feminine at the same time. What a
contrast to a nurse&#8217;s uniform.&#8221;</p>

<p>Jane was willing to admit that the neat, serge
suits would be much more comfortable than
the primly starched outfits they had been accustomed
to wearing.</p>

<p>They had to wait a few minutes until the cab
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_55'></a>55</span>arrived and then they were whirled rapidly
toward the field on the outskirts of the city.</p>

<p>When they reached the airport, Jane went
straight to the waiting room and sat down at a
writing table.</p>

<p>&#8220;Going to write home?&#8221; asked Sue.</p>

<p>&#8220;First of all I&#8217;m writing to Miss Hardy back
at Good Samaritan. After all, it was because of
her interest that we managed to get these positions.
Then I&#8217;ll dash off a letter home.
There&#8217;s half an hour before we report to the
chief stewardess.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I wonder if the folks will object?&#8221; mused
Sue as she sat down at the other side of the desk
and picked up a pen.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m going to tell mine that Miss Hardy
felt it an excellent opportunity. They have
great faith in her and I&#8217;m sure they&#8217;ll not protest.&#8221;</p>

<div>
<a id='ch06'></a>
<p class='line mt3ch center'><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_56'></a>56</span><span class='sc'>Chapter Six</span></p>
<p class='line mb2ch center'><i>Westward Flight</i></p>
</div>

<p><span class='sc'>It was</span> shortly before five o&#8217;clock when Jane
and Sue reported to Miss Comstock at the office
of the personnel director. By five o&#8217;clock all
of the girls who had been signed for the stewardess
service were in the office and Miss Comstock
spoke to them briefly.</p>

<p>&#8220;When we arrive in Cheyenne,&#8221; she explained,
&#8220;you will go through a two weeks&#8217;
training course which I will conduct. The
purpose of this is to thoroughly familiarize you
with your duties and to acquaint you with the
special geographical features of the line for, as
stewardesses, you must not only care for your
passengers but be qualified to answer their
questions. I can assure you that they will ask
a great many. While in training at Cheyenne,
you will make trips over the routes to which
you will be assigned. Since the stewardess
service is to become effective June 10th, you
understand that we have much to do for I am
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_57'></a>57</span>counting on you girls making a fine record on
the line.&#8221;</p>

<p>As Miss Comstock finished speaking, a huge
tri-motor rolled up on the ramp and Charlie
Fischer stuck his head out to look for his passengers.</p>

<p>&#8220;Our plane is waiting. We&#8217;ll have a late
lunch in Omaha,&#8221; said Miss Comstock. &#8220;I
suggest that on the way down you girls introduce
yourselves to one another.&#8221;</p>

<p>With the chief stewardess leading the way,
the girls trooped downstairs. Just ahead of
Jane and Sue were two girls about their own
age.</p>

<p>They turned around and introduced themselves.
The taller one was Grace Huston
while the shorter one, a red-head, was Alice
Blair.</p>

<p>&#8220;We took our training here in the county
hospital,&#8221; said Grace. &#8220;Are you from Chicago?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; replied Jane. &#8220;We flew in from
University City this morning. We graduated
just last night from the training school at Good
Samaritan there.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, that&#8217;s certainly fast work,&#8221; smiled
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_58'></a>58</span>Alice. &#8220;In less than twenty-four hours you&#8217;re
starting on a new career.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Twenty-four hours ago we didn&#8217;t have
any idea what we would be doing,&#8221; confessed
Sue.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m excited about this position,&#8221; said
Grace. &#8220;Think of the thrill of flying day and
night through all kinds of weather!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve thought all about it,&#8221; replied her companion,
&#8220;and it may be too thrilling once in a
while, but it&#8217;s a job and a good paying one.
How do you like the uniforms?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;They&#8217;re fascinating,&#8221; said Jane. &#8220;I can
hardly wait until they are delivered at Cheyenne.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Which reminds me,&#8221; put in Alice, &#8220;that
I&#8217;d like to know what Cheyenne is like.&#8221;</p>

<p>Her question went unanswered for they had
reached the tri-motor and Miss Comstock hurried
her charges inside. Jane and Sue were
fortunate to find a double seat and Grace and
Alice sat directly behind them. The last of the
girls&#8217; baggage was placed aboard and the cabin
door closed and locked. The big ship trembled
as Charlie Fischer opened the throttle. Then
it rolled smoothly down the ramp.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_59'></a>59</span>Other planes were being wheeled from their
hangars and made ready for the overnight
runs. The great airport was almost at the
height of its daily rush.</p>

<p>Jane, next to the window, saw the dispatcher
in his tower signal their pilot to go
ahead.</p>

<p>The motors roared lustily and the plane shot
down the long runway, lifted smoothly into
the air, and started westward, boring into the
setting sun in a slow climb.</p>

<p>Chicago faded behind them as they sped
over the fertile farm land of Illinois.</p>

<p>Jane relaxed in the comfortable chair and
closed her eyes. The nervous strain of the last
few hours had been terrific and she welcomed
the opportunity to rest and relax. Sue, likewise
tired by the day, closed her eyes and both
girls dozed.</p>

<p>They were over the Mississippi at dusk with
the lights of Clinton, Iowa, visible to their
right. Then the plane sped on above the rich
acres of Iowa. Below them the headlights of
automobiles dotted the highways and an occasional
cluster of lights marked a village.
Then a field blazed into blue-white incandescence
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_60'></a>60</span>and the beat of the motors slowed.</p>

<p>Miss Comstock came down the aisle and Sue
asked her their location.</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re landing at Iowa City to refuel.
We&#8217;ll stay there about ten minutes. You can
get out and walk about the hangar if you like.&#8221;</p>

<p>There were only a few people at the airport
when the tri-motor rolled into the hangar and
the girls stepped out of the cabin.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m getting hungry and Omaha is a long
distance ahead,&#8221; said Grace Huston.</p>

<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s a restaurant just a block away, by
that old hangar,&#8221; pointed out Alice. &#8220;We
could get a chocolate bar there. That should
keep off the wolf until Omaha.&#8221;</p>

<p>They agreed that chocolate bars would taste
good and Alice, collecting a dime from each of
her companions, hurried away toward the restaurant.
When she returned, the candy bars
were welcomed eagerly and when the girls
stepped back into the plane they felt refreshed.</p>

<p>The floodlight opened up the night with its
blue-white brilliance and the tri-motor rolled
across the field and soared westward again.
Miss Comstock came down the aisle with an
armful of the latest magazines.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_61'></a>61</span>&#8220;This will be one of your duties,&#8221; she said
as she offered them to Jane and Sue. The girls
made their selection but Jane found her eyes
too heavy for reading. She changed places
with Sue and dozed again while her companion
read.</p>

<p>At the end of another hour, the plane started
bucking sharply and sleep became impossible
for any of the girls.</p>

<p>Miss Comstock came along the aisle and
spoke to each girl.</p>

<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s a bad cross-wind. See that your
safety belts are buckled securely.&#8221;</p>

<p>The plane continued to bounce up and
down, sometimes dropping for what seemed to
Jane hundreds of feet only to bound upward
again with a jarring shock.</p>

<p>Sue was white and perspiration stood out on
her forehead.</p>

<p>&#8220;I hope we won&#8217;t have many trips like this,&#8221;
she gasped. &#8220;Oh, I wish I hadn&#8217;t eaten that
candy!&#8221;</p>

<p>Jane looked around to see how Grace and
Alice were faring. Grace looked like a ghost,
but Alice seemed unaffected. One of the girls
at the rear of the plane became violently nauseated
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_62'></a>62</span>but Miss Comstock, cool and undisturbed
by the rough weather, cared for her.</p>

<p>One thing Jane realized; they were all getting
a thorough test of their weather ability on
their first long flight.</p>

<p>The weather was rough all the rest of the
way to Omaha, but after the first half hour, Sue
recovered her equilibrium and managed to
smile at the white face and tight lips of some
of the other girls. Poor Grace was in agony
most of the way.</p>

<p>&#8220;Lunch is ready at the field restaurant,&#8221;
Miss Comstock announced when they rolled
into the hangar at Omaha.</p>

<p>Various replies greeted her announcement.
Some of the girls were ready to eat, while several
could only groan at the thought of food.</p>

<p>Charlie Fischer climbed down and spoke to
Jane and Sue.</p>

<p>&#8220;A little rough the last hundred and fifty
miles,&#8221; he grinned.</p>

<p>&#8220;It was more than a little rough,&#8221; retorted
Sue. &#8220;It was terribly rough.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Say, that was smooth compared to some of
the weather we strike west of here. You&#8217;ve
got lots of surprises ahead.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_63'></a>63</span>&#8220;I&#8217;ve had enough for one night,&#8221; replied
Sue, &#8220;but maybe I won&#8217;t notice it from now
on.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Some people are all right after the first time
and others never get over air sickness,&#8221; replied
Charlie cheerfully.</p>

<p>&#8220;What a great help you are,&#8221; countered Sue.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m leaving you here. This is the end of
my run tonight. Maybe you&#8217;ll be assigned
with me when you go into active service.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If flying with you means weather like this,
I hope not,&#8221; smiled Jane.</p>

<p>Miss Comstock, anticipating that some of
the girls might be air-sick, had ordered a light
supper and only one of them, Pert Meade, who
had been ill aboard the plane, was unable to
enjoy the attractive meal.</p>

<p>It was eleven o&#8217;clock when they re-entered
the cabin, ready for the flight over the windswept
Nebraska country. A new pilot, an
older man than Charlie Fischer, was at the controls.</p>

<p>The girls took their places, fastened the
safety belts, and the big ship roared away again.</p>

<p>The weather was still rough as they followed
the Platte River valley, riding high above
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_64'></a>64</span>country along which the pioneers had struggled
in the early days of the West. They were
following the U. P. trail, but were covering
in an hour a distance it had taken the first settlers
weeks to traverse.</p>

<p>Jane looked at the air-speed indicator.
They were traveling only a little more than a
hundred miles an hour and she knew that the
wind outside must be blowing a gale. Below
them one of the department of commerce
emergency landing fields, outlined with red,
green, and white border lights, drifted by.
She looked at the route map. The field must
have been Wood River, just west and a little
south of Grand Island. They were still another
hour out of North Platte.</p>

<p>It was well after midnight and most of the
girls were dozing. Jane looked around and saw
Miss Comstock in the last of the single seats on
the left side of the cabin. The chief stewardess
was looking out the window, staring with a
sort of desperate intentness into the night, and
Jane wondered if there was anything wrong.
She listened to the beat of the motors. They
were running smoothly, with whips of blue
flame streaking from the exhausts, and Jane
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_65'></a>65</span>concluded that she had been imagining things
when she decided Miss Comstock was upset.</p>

<p>Several minutes later the chief stewardess
hastened up the aisle and disappeared along the
passage which led to the pilots&#8217; compartment.
She returned almost immediately and snapped
on the top light, flooding the cabin with a
blaze of brilliance. Just then the motor on the
left wing stopped and Jane knew that something
was decidedly wrong for the chief stewardess&#8217;s
face was pale and drawn.</p>

<div>
<a id='ch07'></a>
<p class='line mt3ch center'><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_66'></a>66</span><span class='sc'>Chapter Seven</span></p>
<p class='line mb2ch center'><i>Crash Landing</i></p>
</div>

<p><span class='sc'>Jane</span> shook Sue into wakefulness, and, cupping
her hands so that only Sue could hear,
said, &#8220;Get the sleep out of your eyes. Something&#8217;s
gone wrong. One motor has stopped.&#8221;</p>

<p>Sue, thoroughly aroused at Jane&#8217;s words,
rubbed the sleep from her eyes and sat up
straight. Miss Comstock hurried down the
aisle, shaking the girls into consciousness.
Then she returned to the front of the cabin.
The two other motors had been throttled
down and by speaking in a loud tone, she could
be heard by every girl.</p>

<p>&#8220;We are about to make a forced landing,&#8221;
she began and as she saw quick looks of alarm
flash over the faces of the girls, hastened to add,
&#8220;There is no need for undue alarm. I am sure
no one will be injured for one of the most experienced
pilots on the line is at the controls.
Please see that your safety belts are fastened
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_67'></a>67</span>securely. Try to relax your muscles if that is
possible.&#8221;</p>

<p>The plane heeled sharply as a vicious gust
of wind caught it and Jane looked out, hoping
that lights of one of the emergency landing
fields would be visible. Only a solid mass of
black greeted her eyes and she knew that their
situation was indeed dangerous. Had Miss
Comstock only been talking bravely, attempting
to reassure the girls?</p>

<p>Jane looked at her companions. Apprehension
was written on the face of each one, but
none of them was flinching, a tribute to the fine
courage which their nurses&#8217; training instilled.
They were accustomed to emergencies, even
though this one was more than they had bargained
for on their first long flight.</p>

<p>Jane tried to analyze her own feelings, but
found that there was a peculiar lack of emotion.
There was nothing she could do to ease the situation.
She looked at her companion.</p>

<p>Sue smiled back bravely and reached over
and took Jane&#8217;s hand. It made them feel a little
closer.</p>

<p>&#8220;How far above ground are we?&#8221; asked
Sue.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_68'></a>68</span>The needle on the altimeter dial was jumping
crazily and Jane shook her head. The air
speed was down to eighty miles an hour and
they seemed to be drifting into the wind.</p>

<p>Miss Comstock started to turn off the top
light, but one of the girls asked her to leave it
on. It was much easier sitting there with the
light on than waiting for the crash in the dark.</p>

<p>Miss Comstock walked down the aisle and
Jane marveled at her ability to remain so calm
in the emergency. She admired the chief stewardess
immensely for her control of her nerves,
for Miss Comstock didn&#8217;t appear to be more
than three or four years older. She was a little
shorter than Jane with a tinge of auburn in
her hair and she was dressed in the natty smoke-green
suit which was to mark the stewardesses
of the Federated Airways.</p>

<p>Dozens of thoughts raced through Jane&#8217;s
mind. She wondered what Miss Hardy would
say when she heard about the accident and
what her own folks would do.</p>

<p>Then Miss Comstock was beside her, speaking
loud enough to be heard by all of the girls.</p>

<p>&#8220;We are almost down,&#8221; she told them.
&#8220;Please remain calm.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_69'></a>69</span>Jane wondered what Miss Comstock would
do when they struck. There was no safety
belt to keep her from being tossed about, for
the chief stewardess remained in the aisle.</p>

<p>The landing lights on the wings were trying
to bore into the night, but the air was filled
with dust and Jane knew that the pilots were
feeling their way down blind, hoping for a
good landing.</p>

<p>Every girl sensed that the crash was near
and Sue leaned her head over on Jane&#8217;s shoulder
and closed her eyes. She had always
looked to Jane for the final decision and
now she turned to her for comfort and protection.</p>

<p>The plane lurched heavily and something
ripped against the undercarriage. The lights
in the cabin went out and Jane felt Miss Comstock
pitched into her lap. In a flash she
wrapped her arms around the chief stewardess
and held her as tightly as possible.</p>

<p>There was the sensation of falling blindly
into a great abyss and then came a jarring crash
that seemed to split the cabin apart. After that
there was a silence, broken only by the sobbing
of the wind.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_70'></a>70</span>Jane felt the chief stewardess struggling to
free herself from her arms.</p>

<p>&#8220;Let me go,&#8221; gasped Miss Comstock.
&#8220;We&#8217;ve got to get out of here.&#8221;</p>

<p>Jane released her hold and spoke to Sue.</p>

<p>&#8220;Are you all right?&#8221; she asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;Except for still being scared half to death.&#8221;</p>

<p>Other girls were moving about, unfastening
their safety belts and trying to get to their feet.</p>

<p>&#8220;The cabin&#8217;s on a sharp angle,&#8221; Miss Comstock
told them. &#8220;Take off your belts, get
down in the aisle on your hands and knees, and
follow me to the rear.&#8221;</p>

<p>Jane and Sue obeyed, with Sue directly behind
Miss Comstock. Then came Jane with
Grace Huston and Alice Blair following and
the other girls behind them. No one appeared
to be hurt except for minor bruises and
bumps.</p>

<p>When they reached the door, which had
been torn from its hinges by the impact, Miss
Comstock cautioned them again.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s about six feet to the ground. Slide over
the edge and hang by your hands until your
feet are on the ground. Then each girl wait
until the next is down and we&#8217;ll form a chain
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_71'></a>71</span>of hands so that no one is lost. Count as you
come and we&#8217;ll know when everyone is out.&#8221;</p>

<p>Jane was the first one out and she cried,
&#8220;No. 1 out,&#8221; in a loud voice. Girl after girl
called out their number as they scrambled
down out of the wreckage until every one was
outside.</p>

<p>Still holding hands, Miss Comstock led them
away from the plane as Jane wondered about
the pilots. The wreckage was at least fifty
yards behind when Miss Comstock paused.</p>

<p>&#8220;You girls wait here. I&#8217;m going back and
find the pilots.&#8221;</p>

<p>She started back alone, but Jane slipped out
of the group and joined her.</p>

<p>&#8220;You can&#8217;t go alone,&#8221; she said. &#8220;If they&#8217;re
trapped, maybe I can be of some help.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Go back, Jane,&#8221; ordered the chief stewardess.
&#8220;There&#8217;s the gasoline. Smell it? The
wreckage may catch on fire at any moment.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s just why you need me,&#8221; insisted
Jane.</p>

<p>Miss Comstock hurried on. Jane was determined
and there was no time to waste in
argument.</p>

<p>The tri-motor had landed on a hillside, first
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_72'></a>72</span>striking a fringe of trees which had wrecked
the undercarriage and then skidding along the
hillside until the nose had dug into the ground,
flipping the tail into the air at a crazy angle.</p>

<p>The pilots&#8217; cockpit appeared badly smashed,
but as Miss Comstock and Jane approached, a
man crawled out of the wreckage. It was the
co-pilot, badly battered and only half conscious.</p>

<p>&#8220;Slim&#8217;s in there,&#8221; he gasped, pointing back
at the smashed cockpit.</p>

<p>Miss Comstock lunged ahead, tearing at the
wreckage, hunting for Slim Bollei, the chief
pilot. The smell of gasoline was doubly strong
and Jane realized their grave danger, but she
never wavered in following the chief stewardess.</p>

<p>They found the chief pilot jammed behind
the control wheel.</p>

<p>&#8220;You take his shoulders while I try to free
his feet,&#8221; ordered Miss Comstock. Working
swiftly, they managed to lift the pilot clear
and Jane was thankful that he was slight in
stature. It would have been impossible for
them to carry a heavy man.</p>

<p>They staggered away from the wreckage
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_73'></a>73</span>just as a tongue of flame leaped along the remains
of the right wing.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hurry,&#8221; gasped Miss Comstock. &#8220;We&#8217;ve
got to get farther away.&#8221;</p>

<p>The co-pilot tried to assist them, but he was
too weak to help.</p>

<p>&#8220;Take care of yourself,&#8221; Miss Comstock
told him. &#8220;We&#8217;ll get Slim away.&#8221;</p>

<p>The flames spread rapidly and by the time
they reached the crest of the hill, the wreckage
was an inferno of fire with roaring, twisting
flames leaping into the heavens. Jane shuddered
and closed her eyes and the other girls
huddled close together.</p>

<p>&#8220;This is no time for anyone to have hysterics,&#8221;
said the steel-nerved Miss Comstock.
She turned to the co-pilot. &#8220;Did you get a
message out that we were crashing?&#8221; she asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, but I don&#8217;t know whether it got
through. The static has been terrific for the
last hour.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Where are we?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Somewhere between Wood River and
Kearney and a little south of the line. The
Platte can&#8217;t be far south of us.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t care where the Platte is. I want to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_74'></a>74</span>get to a phone and find a doctor for Slim and
report to the line,&#8221; snapped Miss Comstock.
She turned to Sue and Alice.</p>

<p>&#8220;You girls take charge here. Do what you
can for these men while Jane and I start out to
see if we can find a farmhouse with a telephone.&#8221;</p>

<p>Leaving the other girls on the hilltop, Miss
Comstock and Jane plunged away into the
night. The chief stewardess strode rapidly,
and Jane found it difficult to keep up with her,</p>

<p>&#8220;Perhaps a farmer will be attracted by the
flames,&#8221; she gasped as they topped another hill.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s not likely. If the co-pilot was right,
we&#8217;re in a rather desolate spot just north of the
river. We&#8217;ll keep going and see what we can
locate.&#8221;</p>

<p>For half an hour they plodded steadily ahead
until they struck a dirt road running at right
angles to their own course.</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll turn to the left. At least we&#8217;ll be
going toward Kearney,&#8221; said Miss Comstock.</p>

<p>They trudged a mile down the road before
they came to a farmhouse. A dog greeted
them with lusty barks and the farmer threw up
a window on the second floor.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_75'></a>75</span>&#8220;What&#8217;s going on out there?&#8221; he cried.</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re stewardesses on the Federated Airways,&#8221;
Miss Comstock shouted. &#8220;Our plane
crashed about an hour ago in the hills over
toward the Platte. We&#8217;ve got to get to a
phone so we can call a doctor and inform the
line about the accident.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Come right in. I&#8217;ll be down in a minute.&#8221;</p>

<p>A light flashed in the room upstairs and the
farmer, dressing hastily, hurried down.</p>

<p>Miss Comstock almost rang the telephone
off the wall in trying to arouse the operator on
the rural line, but at last got her call through to
the field at Kearney and told the night man
there what had happened.</p>

<p>The farmer supplied them with directions
for the field relief crew and the Kearney men
promised to arrive with a doctor within the
hour. The farmer&#8217;s wife hastened down and
insisted on making coffee and sandwiches.</p>

<p>&#8220;Was anyone badly injured?&#8221; she asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;The chief pilot is hurt, but I don&#8217;t know
how seriously,&#8221; replied Miss Comstock.</p>

<p>&#8220;But isn&#8217;t it dangerous for girls like you to
be flying in those airplanes?&#8221; asked the farmer&#8217;s
wife.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_76'></a>76</span>&#8220;It was tonight,&#8221; smiled Miss Comstock,
&#8220;but as a rule it is as safe as riding in a railroad
train and much safer than traveling in an automobile.
What do you think about it, Jane?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I think it&#8217;s thrilling, but the crash tonight
will be enough to last me for the rest of my
life,&#8221; she replied.</p>

<p>&#8220;It will probably be the first and last one
you&#8217;ll ever have. Flying is getting safer every
day. You certainly had your baptism under
fire the first night out.&#8221;</p>

<div>

<p class='line mb2ch center'><i>Winning Their Wings</i></p>
</div>

<p><span class='sc'>The</span> crew from the Kearney field arrived in
a large truck and trailing them was an ambulance
with a doctor and two nurses. The
farmer joined the party and helped guide them
to the shivering group on the hilltop north of
the Platte.</p>

<p>The wreckage of the tri-motor had long
since ceased to glow and the wind whined dismally
through a low growth of underbrush.
Sue was the first to reach the truck and Miss
Comstock fairly leaped after her.</p>

<p>&#8220;How&#8217;s the pilot and co-pilot?&#8221; she asked,
anxiety making her voice sound unnatural.</p>

<p>&#8220;They&#8217;ll come through all right,&#8221; said Sue.
&#8220;I think the pilot has a slight concussion and
his right arm is broken. The co-pilot is only
suffering from shock and bruises.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And the girls?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;They&#8217;re all right. When the fire died
down a bit, several of them even tried to get
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_78'></a>78</span>close enough to salvage some of the mail, but
the flames leaped up again and forced them
back.&#8221;</p>

<p>The flyers were carried to the waiting ambulance
and that vehicle soon lurched away
over the uneven ground.</p>

<p>The crew from the Kearney field had
brought powerful electric torches and with
these they made a thorough survey of the tri-motor.
It was a charred mass of twisted steel
tubing, little resembling the proud ship which
had bucked the storm a few hours before.</p>

<p>&#8220;The company can write about $80,000 off
the books,&#8221; growled the manager of the
Kearney field. &#8220;I wonder how it happened?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The left wing started to flutter,&#8221; said Miss
Comstock. &#8220;I could tell from the vibration
of the ship something was wrong and when I
went up into the cockpit Slim Bollei told me
we were in a jam. He was afraid the wing was
going to tear loose so he cut the left motor.
With the wind bad and the wing loosening up
more every second we were in the air he had to
hunt a place to set down quick.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, he sure put this crate down for
keeps,&#8221; grunted the manager. &#8220;Guess we
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_79'></a>79</span>might as well start back to the field and I&#8217;ll
write up a report of the accident.&#8221;</p>

<p>The girls piled into the big truck, Jane and
Sue sitting at the very end with their feet hanging
over.</p>

<p>&#8220;What a night,&#8221; said Sue as the truck moved
away from the scene of the accident. &#8220;For
a while I was afraid I wasn&#8217;t going to live
through it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m still shaky,&#8221; confessed Grace Huston,
who was just behind them.</p>

<p>&#8220;It wasn&#8217;t pleasant,&#8221; admitted Jane, &#8220;but
we&#8217;re all lucky to be out alive and with the
pilots only slightly injured. However, as Miss
Comstock says, this will probably be our first
and last crash and it might as well come early.&#8221;</p>

<p>When they reached the Kearney field, Miss
Comstock got in touch with the operations
manager at Cheyenne and informed him that
another plane would be needed to take her
charges to Cheyenne.</p>

<p>It was daylight when Cheyenne finally came
back with flying orders. A special plane was
being ordered out of Omaha to take the girls
the remainder of the distance.</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll have several hours here,&#8221; Miss Comstock
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_80'></a>80</span>informed them, &#8220;so I&#8217;ve chartered several
cabs to take us uptown for breakfast. We&#8217;ll
go to the hotel, clean up and relax. Lunch
will be in Cheyenne.&#8221;</p>

<p>They were about to leave the field when a
young man hurried up.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m the Associated Press correspondent
here,&#8221; he explained, &#8220;and I&#8217;m looking for the
stewardess in charge.&#8221;</p>

<p>Miss Comstock stepped forward. &#8220;What
can I do for you?&#8221; she asked.</p>

<p>The reporter grinned. &#8220;Just tell me all
about the accident. I&#8217;ve got the pilots&#8217; names
from the hospital and a few details, but I&#8217;d
like to have all of the facts.&#8221;</p>

<p>Jane was surprised when Miss Comstock told
him everything about the accident.</p>

<p>&#8220;Please say that the new girls were especially
calm and cool-headed in their first
emergency,&#8221; she said. &#8220;If it had not been for
the assistance of one of them I fear the pilot
would never have been pulled out of the
wreckage before the plane caught fire.&#8221;</p>

<p>The reporter insisted on having Jane&#8217;s name.</p>

<p>&#8220;This will make a great human-interest
story,&#8221; he exclaimed as he hurried away.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_81'></a>81</span>Miss Comstock turned to the girls.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s a little lesson in public relations,&#8221;
she said. &#8220;The policy of the line is to tell the
newspaper people the truth. If you try to hide
or distort facts, the reporters will learn part of
them in some other way and it is much better
to have the truth sent out in the first place.&#8221;</p>

<p>After breakfast at the hotel, Jane and Sue
went into the writing room.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m going to write my parents about everything
that happened last night,&#8221; said Sue.
&#8220;Then they won&#8217;t worry when they read the
newspaper stories.&#8221;</p>

<p>Jane agreed that it was a splendid idea and
they passed half an hour at their letter writing
before Miss Comstock came in to inform them
that it was time to return to the field.</p>

<p>As they reached the airport a tri-motor
swung in from the east. It swooped low over
the field and an arm was flung out of the cockpit
in a friendly greeting to the girls who were
standing beside the hangar. The tri-motor
nosed around into the wind and dropped down
to an easy landing.</p>

<p>When it stopped in the hangar, the pilot
stuck his head out of the cockpit.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_82'></a>82</span>&#8220;Hi, there,&#8221; he called to Jane and Sue. &#8220;I
hear you won your wings last night.&#8221; It was
Charlie Fischer, who had flown them from
Chicago to Omaha the night before.</p>

<p>&#8220;You mean we had them clipped and
singed,&#8221; retorted Jane.</p>

<p>Charlie climbed down from the cockpit.</p>

<p>&#8220;How&#8217;s Slim Bollei?&#8221; he asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;Just a slight crack on his head,&#8221; said Sue.
&#8220;I hear that they select men with hard heads
for pilots.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ouch!&#8221; grinned Charlie. &#8220;I&#8217;m going to
wear armor the next time I talk to you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You needn&#8217;t. I don&#8217;t even bite.&#8221;</p>

<p>The pilot turned to Miss Comstock.</p>

<p>&#8220;Get your cargo aboard,&#8221; he said, &#8220;and
we&#8217;ll take off in about five minutes. They
routed me out at Omaha and started me west
before I had time to get anything to eat. We&#8217;ll
start as soon as I can rustle a cup of coffee and
a sandwich at the shanty across the road.&#8221;</p>

<p>By this time the girls had become fairly well
acquainted and already little groups were being
formed. Jane was pleased that Alice and
Grace had personalities that fitted in so
smoothly with her own and Sue&#8217;s. There
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_83'></a>83</span>would be much to learn and much to do in the
coming weeks and it would be much pleasanter
getting accustomed to the new environment if
friends were near-by.</p>

<p>The air was cool and sweet. The wind had
subsided and there was no trace of the terror
it had wrought the night before as the girls took
their places and fastened the safety belts around
their bodies.</p>

<p>Charlie Fischer, still munching a sandwich,
hurried into the hangar, signed the gas and oil
record book, climbed into his cockpit and
gunned the motors. The big biplane rolled
smoothly ahead, turned its nose into the wind,
and started climbing skyward. They were off
on the last lap of their trip to Cheyenne.</p>

<p class='line mb2ch center'><i>At Mrs. Murphy&#8217;s</i></p>
</div>

<p><span class='sc'>Jane</span> had secretly wondered just how she
would feel when the plane soared into the sky.
After the experience of the night before she
feared that a numbing fright might grip her
and she was greatly relieved when there was no
feeling of apprehension.</p>

<p>Instead, she thoroughly enjoyed the smooth
upward flight, the pulsating power of the great
motors, and the panorama unfolding beneath.
She turned to look at Sue. Her companion was
gripping the arms of her chair tightly, her eyes
bright and staring straight ahead. When Jane
started to speak to her, she shook her head, but
Jane watched Sue closely for the next few
minutes.</p>

<p>Gradually Sue relaxed and a little later she
leaned over and spoke to Jane.</p>

<p>&#8220;I was fighting down a little bugaboo of
fear,&#8221; she grinned. &#8220;I knew if I didn&#8217;t conquer
it all by myself, I&#8217;d never be able to do it.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_85'></a>85</span>Now I&#8217;ll never be afraid to fly anywhere and
anytime.&#8221;</p>

<p>Jane thought that statement was a little bold,
but she hoped it was true.</p>

<p>Keeping to the right of the broad Platte, they
sped westward with the speed indicator wavering
between 115 and 120 miles an hour for
there was only a slight head wind dropping
down from the far-away Rockies.</p>

<p>North Platte appeared ahead and Jane consulted
the map of their route. North Platte
was a regular passenger stop, but they were
running as a special, and the plane dropped
over the southwestern Nebraska city. Here
the Platte forked, one branch swinging northwest
while the South Platte continued almost
straight west.</p>

<p>The shining steel of the Union Pacific rails
caught the sunlight far below and Jane saw
the smoky plume of a transcontinental limited
threading its way westward. The plane soon
overhauled the train and left it far behind.
They were too high for any of the girls to
wave. The country became rougher, more
desolate, and the few farms looked drear and
beaten down by the buffeting of the elements.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_86'></a>86</span>They passed north of Sidney and not long
afterward Jane knew they were in Wyoming.</p>

<p>It was just north of Pine Bluffs that Jane
got her first glimpse of the Rockies. The air
was clear and the visibility excellent. Far
away to the west and south she saw the snowy
summit of what she was later to know as Long&#8217;s
Peak and other lesser mountains reared their
heads into view.</p>

<p>Jane touched Sue&#8217;s arm, and called her attention
to the beauty of the distant scene. Together
they watched, breathlessly, the great
vista of the mountains.</p>

<p>It was not long after that until a good-sized
city came into view to their left and Jane, looking
at the altimeter, knew the plane was nosing
down. This, then, must be Cheyenne, the
chief operating base for Federated Airways&#8217;
transcontinental line and the city which was to
be the headquarters of the stewardess service.</p>

<p>The tri-motor swung over the sprawling,
one-time pioneer city and dropped down on
the airport, which was a little more than a mile
north of the city.</p>

<p>Jane was astounded by the size of the field
and the largeness of the hangars which flanked
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_87'></a>87</span>the side nearest Cheyenne. At first glance it
seemed almost as large as the field at Chicago.</p>

<p>They rolled into an immense hangar, behind
which towered the brick building which
housed the administrative offices of the Federated
Airways. It was here that Jane and Sue
were to go to school before they went into active
service.</p>

<p>Miss Comstock led them through the waiting
room, into the administration building and
down to a new, one-story wing which had just
been completed. Drawing a key from a
pocket, she unlocked the door and turned to
the girls.</p>

<p>&#8220;This new wing was built especially for the
stewardess service. There is a classroom, a
complete kitchen and commissary, lockers,
lounging room and shower. I&#8217;m sure you&#8217;ll
like it.&#8221;</p>

<p>Jane stepped into the lounging room. It was
delightfully furnished in wicker and the walls
were a soft grey with rose-colored drapes at
the full-length windows which looked out
upon the field.</p>

<p>The commissary, lined with cupboards for
the storage of supplies, was in silver and blue,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_88'></a>88</span>and arranged to gladden the heart of any girl.
The sinks were of stainless steel and the large
tables at which the lunches would be prepared
were of a similar material.</p>

<p>They went on to the classroom, which reminded
Jane of a similar room she had attended
so many times at Good Samaritan. A score of
study chairs were in the room and one whole
wall was given over to a blackboard while on
another wall was complete map of the entire
Federated Airways system.</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll have our first class right now,&#8221; said
Miss Comstock, &#8220;since I want to give you instructions
on obtaining rooms in Cheyenne.&#8221;</p>

<p>The girls sat down, Sue, Alice and Grace
grouped around Jane.</p>

<p>&#8220;As you know, headquarters of the stewardess
service will be here,&#8221; went on Miss Comstock,
&#8220;and you are to regard Cheyenne as your
home. It will be necessary for you to find
suitable rooms and you will be required to pay
for these out of your regular salary. However,
when you are at the other end of your trip, the
line will see that you are properly domiciled.&#8221;</p>

<p>She paused for a moment as she picked up a
sheet of paper from her desk.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_89'></a>89</span>&#8220;I have made a survey of rooms in Cheyenne,&#8221;
she continued, &#8220;and have approved all
of the rooms listed below. They are in excellent
homes, the rates are reasonable and I
am sure you will find any of them pleasant. I
want you to take the remainder of the day to
locate your rooms and see something of Cheyenne.
We&#8217;ll start actual classwork tomorrow
morning at nine o&#8217;clock. Now, if you will
consult me individually, I will make room
recommendations. Cars owned by the line
will take you into the city.&#8221;</p>

<p>Jane turned toward Alice and Grace.</p>

<p>&#8220;I think it would be nice if we could obtain
two large rooms and you two would live with
Sue and me. It might cut down our room rent
and with four of us living together, some one
would be home most of the time.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;My vote is yes,&#8221; replied Grace.</p>

<p>&#8220;You can make it unanimous,&#8221; smiled Alice.
&#8220;I only hope we&#8217;ll be assigned to about the
same runs so we can be at home at the same
time.&#8221;</p>

<p>When Miss Comstock called her name, Jane
stepped forward and explained their plan.</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course I have no objections,&#8221; said the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_90'></a>90</span>chief stewardess. She looked at the list of
prospective rooms on the sheet of paper in her
hand.</p>

<p>&#8220;I think I have just the rooms for you.
Mrs. Dennis Murphy has two fine rooms and a
sleeping porch adjoining. She is a widow and
anxious to get roomers.&#8221;</p>

<p>Miss Comstock wrote Mrs. Murphy&#8217;s address
on a slip of paper.</p>

<p>&#8220;Go there first. If you don&#8217;t like Mrs.
Murphy&#8217;s, telephone me here and I&#8217;ll give you
some more suggestions.&#8221;</p>

<p>The girls found a field car waiting outside
the main entrance of the administration
building and the driver sped them toward the
city.</p>

<p>Mrs. Murphy lived on a side street in a
square, two-story frame house. The yard was
well kept and a broad, shady porch ran the full
length of the front of the house.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll wait until you know whether you&#8217;re
going to stay,&#8221; said the driver.</p>

<p>Jane seemed to be the self-appointed leader
of the group and she hurried up the walk and
knocked at the screen door.</p>

<p>&#8220;Come in,&#8221; called a cheery voice from
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_91'></a>91</span>somewhere in the interior. Jane hesitated for
a moment.</p>

<p>&#8220;Go on in,&#8221; Sue urged, so Jane opened the
door and crossed the porch.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m in the kitchen with me hands in bread
dough,&#8221; explained the voice, in a rich, heavy
Irish brogue and Jane knew that Mrs. Murphy
in person was at home.</p>

<p>A long hallway led past the living room and
the dining room into the kitchen, a large well-lighted
room.</p>

<p>Mrs, Murphy, buxom and ruddy of cheek,
looked up as Jane entered. Her hands were
deep in bread dough.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, goodness sakes alive,&#8221; she exclaimed
when she saw Jane. &#8220;If I&#8217;d known it was a
stranger, I&#8217;d have answered the door. I
thought it was Mrs. McGillicuddy down the
street, come to borrow something, for she&#8217;s
always running in of a morning, being short of
this or that, and having to have a bit to get along
until the delivery boy gets around.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, that&#8217;s quite all right, Mrs. Murphy,&#8221;
smiled Jane. &#8220;I&#8217;m one of the new stewardesses
for the Federated Airways. There are three
other girls here with me. We&#8217;re looking for
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_92'></a>92</span>two double rooms and Miss Comstock at the
field recommended you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Now that&#8217;s right nice of her. She was here
last week looking at my rooms and seemed to
like them real well. If you&#8217;ll wait a bit until
I finish kneading down the bread, I&#8217;ll take you
right up. Just make yourselves at home on the
porch.&#8221;</p>

<p>Jane rejoined her companions and informed
them that Mrs. Murphy would be out as soon
as the bread was safe.</p>

<p>Sue looked around the porch. Everything
was well-worn but comfortable.</p>

<p>&#8220;After three years in a hospital this is luxury,&#8221;
she said, sinking down into a broad
rocker.</p>

<p>&#8220;From the little talk I had with Mrs. Murphy
in the kitchen and the smell of things cooking
in her oven, I think this will be a grand place
to live,&#8221; said Jane.</p>

<p>&#8220;Maybe we&#8217;ll be lucky enough to get some
fresh bread and have bread and sugar,&#8221; suggested
Grace, looking longingly toward the
kitchen.</p>

<p>In less than five minutes Mrs. Murphy,
wearing a fresh apron, appeared from the dim
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_93'></a>93</span>shadows of the hallway. Jane introduced each
of the girls.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m happy to know you,&#8221; Mrs. Murphy
told them, and they felt that she really meant
it. There was something homey and warm
about Mrs. Murphy that touched the heart of
each one.</p>

<p>She led the way upstairs and to the rear of the
house where two adjoining rooms opened onto
a large sleeping porch. The rooms were large
and airy, the beds were comfortable and the
furnishings, though plain, were adequate.</p>

<p>From the porch there was an excellent view
of the distant mountains. Mrs. Murphy explained
that the bathroom was just down the
hall and that her only other roomer was the
cashier of a downtown department store.</p>

<p>The telephone, ringing insistently, summoned
Mrs. Murphy downstairs and gave
the girls an opportunity to talk about the
rooms.</p>

<p>Jane went back to the sleeping porch to enjoy
the view of the mountains. Her mind was
made up and she was quite willing to stay with
Mrs. Murphy.</p>

<p>&#8220;There isn&#8217;t a whole lot of closet room,&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_94'></a>94</span>said Grace, &#8220;and the furniture is rather plain.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But the rooms are large and pleasant and the
sleeping porch will be grand,&#8221; said Sue.</p>

<p>Alice, who had been exploring the bathroom,
brought back good news.</p>

<p>&#8220;The bath is fine. Lots of room, a huge tub
with a shower, and two lavatories with plate-glass
mirrors.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then I call for a vote,&#8221; said Sue.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mine is yes,&#8221; said Jane, returning from the
porch. Grace, Alice and Sue added their approval
as Mrs. Murphy came puffing upstairs.</p>

<p>&#8220;We like the rooms,&#8221; Jane told her. &#8220;How
much is the rent?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve been getting $40 a month,&#8221; said Mrs,
Murphy, &#8220;but times as they are, I&#8217;ll rent them
now for $32. That would be $8 apiece and, of
course, there&#8217;s the privilege of doing your
laundry in the basement.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How about meals?&#8221; asked Alice.</p>

<p>&#8220;I haven&#8217;t been taking boarders for a year,
but I guess I haven&#8217;t lost my hand at setting a
good table. It could be arranged.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then I think the price for the rooms is fair
enough,&#8221; said Jane. &#8220;A driver with a field car
is outside. We&#8217;ll bring up our bags and our
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_95'></a>95</span>other luggage will have to be shipped in later.&#8221;</p>

<p>By the time they had unpacked their bags, it
was well past lunch time and the delicious odor
of freshly-baked bread floated upstairs from the
kitchen.</p>

<p>&#8220;That makes me realize that I&#8217;m really
hungry,&#8221; confessed Sue. &#8220;I wonder how far it
is to the nearest restaurant.&#8221;</p>

<p>From below came Mrs. Murphy&#8217;s pleasant
voice.</p>

<p>&#8220;Lunch is on the table, girls. It&#8217;s not much,
but it will save you a trip down town.&#8221;</p>

<p>They trooped downstairs to find the dining-room
table set with appetizing food. There
was a large plate of bread, so fresh from the
oven it was still warm, and a bowl of honey.
Wisps of steam ascended from a large platter of
hash at one end of the table while at the other
was a bowl of fresh cottage cheese. A glass of
milk was beside each plate and a platter filled
with fruit centered the table.</p>

<p>&#8220;This is grand of you, Mrs. Murphy,&#8221; said
Sue.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m going to have bread and butter and
sugar,&#8221; cried Grace. &#8220;It&#8217;s been ages since I&#8217;ve
had a treat like that.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_96'></a>96</span>Mrs. Murphy eased her motherly bulk into
the chair at the head of the table and smiled
happily at the evident relish with which the
girls ate lunch. There was no question about
their having found pleasant quarters for their
home while in Cheyenne.</p>

<p class='line mb2ch center'><i>Jane&#8217;s First Call</i></p>
</div>

<p><span class='sc'>The</span> following days were busy ones for Jane
and her companions. Long hours were passed
at the field in the classroom and in the commissary
where the girls underwent an intensive
period of training.</p>

<p>Miss Comstock was an exacting teacher, but
a fair one and she was almost universally popular
with the girls. Only one, Mattie Clark,
seemed to resent the strict discipline which the
chief stewardess imposed.</p>

<p>Mattie, a black-haired, dark-eyed girl, answered
Miss Comstock sharply on several
occasions. Once the chief stewardess reprimanded
her recalcitrant pupil before the entire
class. Later Mattie vowed that she would
gain revenge.</p>

<p>&#8220;What do you think of Mattie&#8217;s attitude?&#8221;
asked Sue as she stood outside the administration
building with Jane, Grace and Alice.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s only going to cause trouble for Mattie,&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_98'></a>98</span>replied Jane. &#8220;Miss Comstock is fair. She&#8217;s
got a hard job in preparing a bunch of new girls
for this work, but I think she&#8217;s doing it
well.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;She gets pretty cross at times,&#8221; put in Alice.</p>

<p>&#8220;You would, too, if you were asked as many
dumb questions as she is,&#8221; retorted Jane.</p>

<p>Just then Mattie joined them. She was still
resentful over the reprimand from the instructor
and was grumbling to herself.</p>

<p>&#8220;That skinny piece of baggage isn&#8217;t going
to bawl me out in front of the class and get
away with it,&#8221; she told them, her black eyes
snapping. &#8220;I&#8217;ve got some pull in the Federated
Airways front office and I&#8217;m going to use it.
Maybe Miss Comstock will be working for me
some day.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, what do you think of that?&#8221; asked
Sue as Mattie left them.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mattie&#8217;s partially right. That is, she has
some influence in the Chicago office. Her
uncle is publicity director for Federated, but I
don&#8217;t believe she&#8217;ll ever be able to cause Miss
Comstock any real trouble,&#8221; was Jane&#8217;s
opinion.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mattie has dreams of being chief stewardess,&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_99'></a>99</span>explained Grace. &#8220;She told me the
other day that she could certainly do a better
job of handling this group than Miss Comstock.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I&#8217;m putting Mattie down as a
thorough trouble maker and the less I see and
know about her the better I&#8217;ll like it,&#8221; said
Jane firmly.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll paddle right along with you,&#8221; added
Grace. &#8220;Mattie isn&#8217;t headed in the direction I
like.&#8221;</p>

<p>The girls had been too tired at night to even
think of attending a show before but that evening
they walked down town and enjoyed a
movie. On the way home they stopped for
sodas and it was late when they reached Mrs.
Murphy&#8217;s. Jane was surprised to see their
landlady waiting for them.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s about time you were getting in,&#8221; she
exclaimed. &#8220;The field has been calling every
fifteen minutes. Miss Comstock wants you to
telephone her right away. Next time you go
to a show, let me know where you&#8217;re going.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I&#8217;m sorry it was so much trouble,&#8221;
said Jane.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8217;Twas no trouble,&#8221; smiled Mrs. Murphy,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_100'></a>100</span>&#8220;but the field has been very anxious to locate
you.&#8221;</p>

<p>Jane hastened to the telephone and put in a
call for the airport. A summons at that time
of night was puzzling for class work was over
hours before and none of the girls had been assigned
to regular duty. That was to come day
after tomorrow, when the final minor alterations
on their uniforms had been completed and
the last test passed.</p>

<p>The other girls crowded near the telephone,
all of them anxious for the news from the field.</p>

<p>The operations office answered promptly
and Jane gave them her name. The night
manager poured his message into her ear in a
staccato too fast for the other girls to hear.
Jane tingled all over as she listened and her
reply was mechanical.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll be there right away,&#8221; she promised.</p>

<p>&#8220;Where are you going right away?&#8221; demanded
Sue.</p>

<p>&#8220;Chicago,&#8221; smiled Jane, turning from the
telephone and dashing upstairs two steps at a
time.</p>

<p>The other girls raced after to find Jane in
her room already pulling off her dress.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_101'></a>101</span>&#8220;Sue, get my uniform out,&#8221; begged Jane as
she struggled with her dress, &#8220;and Grace, see if
you can find those new smoked-grey hose in
the top drawer of the dresser. Alice, run some
water in the tub. I&#8217;ve got to be at the field
in twenty minutes.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But what&#8217;s it all about?&#8221; Sue insisted as the
girls rushed to help Jane.</p>

<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s a special plane from the west coast
going through to New York with Mrs. Van
Verity Vanness, who is worth a billion or so,
aboard. It&#8217;s on a fast schedule for she is rushing
to New York to the bedside of a son who
is seriously ill. Salt Lake radioed that Mrs.
Van Verity Vanness was anything but comfortable
and the general manager has ordered
a stewardess aboard to see what can be done to
make her happier the rest of the way to Chicago.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How lucky!&#8221; exclaimed Sue. &#8220;Why,
you&#8217;re getting the first assignment and you&#8217;ll
be flying nearly two days ahead of any of the
rest of us.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not so sure I&#8217;m lucky,&#8221; replied Jane
as she splashed vigorously in the tub. &#8220;Any
woman who has as many millions as Mrs. Van
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_102'></a>102</span>Verity Vanness is bound to be mighty particular.
It would be just my luck to have her sick
all of the way in and have a complaint lodged
against me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But if she likes you and the service, she&#8217;ll
probably give you a real compliment,&#8221; said
Sue.</p>

<p>&#8220;And maybe a present,&#8221; added Alice.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now you&#8217;re all getting too far ahead,&#8221; protested
Jane. &#8220;I&#8217;ve got to get to the field first
of all.&#8221;</p>

<p>When Jane returned to her room, the girls
had her uniform all ready for her to step into.
The smoke-green serge fitted Jane snugly and
the beret perched at a pert angle on her brown
hair. She adjusted the seams of the new hose
and slipped into dark grey pumps which were
a part of the uniform. With deft fingers she
centered the green tie of her shirt-waist and
stuck a fresh handkerchief in her left coat
pocket. Quick touches with the powder puff
removed the shine from her nose and she gave
her hair a final pat just as the horn on one of
the field&#8217;s cars blared outside.</p>

<p>&#8220;Stand still a minute,&#8221; begged Sue. &#8220;I want
to get a good look at you.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_103'></a>103</span>&#8220;There&#8217;s no time for a dress rehearsal,&#8221;
smiled Jane, but she turned around slowly so
the others could see her in the complete outfit.</p>

<p>&#8220;You look grand,&#8221; whispered Grace.
&#8220;Every pilot on the line will be in love with you
before morning.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I won&#8217;t see every pilot,&#8221; retorted Jane.</p>

<p>&#8220;Maybe not, but they&#8217;ll hear about you,&#8221;
Grace insisted.</p>

<p>In the smoke-green uniform Jane was indeed
an attractive figure. The coat was cut
smartly and there were fashionable box pleats
in the skirt. The beret, set at a jaunty angle,
had only one ornament, a pair of silver wings.
Shoes and hose to match the suit completed
the ensemble.</p>

<p>Jane took a final glance in the mirror. What
she saw there was pleasing and she ran downstairs,
the others following her closely.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m off on my first trip,&#8221; she called to Mrs.
Murphy, who was reading in the front room.
&#8220;I&#8217;ll be in Chicago tomorrow morning.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A safe trip, bless you,&#8221; called Mrs. Murphy,
who had taken an exceedingly motherly
interest in the girls.</p>

<p>&#8220;Will you bring us back if we go to the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_104'></a>104</span>field?&#8221; Alice asked the driver of the airport
car.</p>

<p>&#8220;Sorry, Miss, but I&#8217;m through in fifteen
minutes. This is my last trip to town.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Just our luck,&#8221; grumbled Alice. &#8220;You&#8217;ll
have to start off on your first trip without an
audience,&#8221; she told Jane.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d like to have you there, but maybe I
won&#8217;t be quite as nervous if I am alone,&#8221; admitted
Jane. She entered the cab and the
driver closed the door.</p>

<p>Sue stuck her head through the lower window.</p>

<p>&#8220;When will you be back?&#8221; she asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;I haven&#8217;t the slightest idea. Not until day
after tomorrow at the earliest.&#8221;</p>

<p>The cab lurched ahead and with the goodbyes
of her friends ringing in her ears Jane
started for the field and her first assignment.</p>

<p class='line mb2ch center'><i>An Unexpected Delay</i></p>
</div>

<p><span class='sc'>The</span> airport was ablaze with light when the car
pulled up at the administration building, which
meant that Mrs. Van Verity Vanness&#8217; special
plane was about to land.</p>

<p>Jane thanked the driver and hastened into
the operations office on the first floor. A
teletype was clicking out the latest weather reports
and the radio operator was busy giving
the pilot of the special plane final information
on the wind and visibility at Cheyenne.</p>

<p>Miss Comstock, who had been talking to the
night chief of operations, turned to Jane.</p>

<p>&#8220;I was afraid we weren&#8217;t going to locate
you,&#8221; the chief stewardess said, visibly relieved
at Jane&#8217;s arrival. &#8220;This is an important trip
and I knew I could count on you to make a
good impression.&#8221;</p>

<p>The night operations chief joined them.</p>

<p>&#8220;This special is going through ahead of
everything,&#8221; he told Jane, &#8220;and we can&#8217;t have
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_106'></a>106</span>it delayed if Mrs. Van Verity Vanness gets air
sick and they have to slow the schedule or set
the ship down at some field to wait until she
feels better. In other words, it&#8217;s up to you to
see that she is so comfortable from now on and
so busy she won&#8217;t have time to think about
complaining.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Is she ill now?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Salt Lake said she looked like a ghost and
Rock Springs just cussed when I asked him how
she looked. One thing, we&#8217;re going to get that
special off this field and from then on it&#8217;s up to
you to see that Mrs. Van Verity Vanness holds
together until we land in Chicago.&#8221;</p>

<p>Charlie Fischer strolled in and glanced at
the weather report coming in on the teletype.</p>

<p>&#8220;Plenty of visibility and a good tail wind.
I&#8217;m going to take that three-engined demon up
where there&#8217;s plenty of room and ride it for
all it&#8217;s worth. You can put me down for about
160 miles an hour from here to Omaha,&#8221; he
told the night operations chief.</p>

<p>&#8220;If you can do that, you&#8217;ll whittle better
than half an hour off the schedule we&#8217;ve
worked out,&#8221; said the night chief.</p>

<p>Charlie turned to Jane.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_107'></a>107</span>&#8220;You going along?&#8221; he asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s my first regular trip.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Means extra ballast,&#8221; grumbled Charlie.</p>

<p>&#8220;Extra ballast nothing,&#8221; retorted the night
chief. &#8220;Our billion-dollar passenger is air sick
and unless we put a stewardess aboard and get
Mrs. Van Verity Vanness feeling better
pronto, this flight will be a washout and about
$10,000 will fly out of this airway&#8217;s sock and
you can imagine how the general manager
would like that.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You mean we&#8217;re getting $10,000 for this
trip across the country?&#8221; asked Charlie incredulously.</p>

<p>&#8220;She paid before she started the trip in
&#8217;Frisco, but if we don&#8217;t land her in New York
on time she&#8217;ll stop payment on the check. So
when you&#8217;re in the air tonight just bend an ear
to whatever this little lady has to say, for if
you do some rough flying and the G. M. hears
about it, one Charlie Fischer will have a lot of
explaining to do.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The special&#8217;s coming in right now,&#8221; called
the radio operator. They turned to the full-length
windows which looked out on the field.
The wing lights of the plane were swooping
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_108'></a>108</span>down and a moment later the big ship rolled
down the runway and nosed toward the
hangar.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve got a complete kit ready,&#8221; Miss Comstock
told Jane. &#8220;There&#8217;s plenty of salad and
hot coffee, fresh fruit, and I put in an extra
thermos bottle of bouillon. I imagine your
passenger is nervous and scared as much as anything.
Make her comfortable and talk to her.
Remember that the reputation of the stewardess
service may depend on your work tonight.&#8221;</p>

<p>Almost before the tri-motor had stopped
rolling the ground crew, enlarged to speed the
refueling of the special, was swarming over the
plane. Only five minutes had been allowed for
the Cheyenne stop and it meant fast work on
the part of every man.</p>

<p>Jane and Miss Comstock hastened toward
the cabin. As they reached it the co-pilot
threw open the door.</p>

<p>&#8220;For heaven&#8217;s sake, hurry,&#8221; he begged.
&#8220;I&#8217;m afraid this woman is going to faint.&#8221;</p>

<p>Jane got a glimpse of the white, drawn face
of Mrs. Van Verity Vanness and she knew
that she was going to be in for some busy
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_109'></a>109</span>minutes. The landing stage was wheeled up to
the plane and Jane hurried into the cabin. The
one passenger aboard the special was clinging
to the co-pilot and Jane gently disengaged her
arms and placed them about her own shoulders.</p>

<p>Mrs. Van Verity Vanness was sobbing
softly. &#8220;I&#8217;ll never be able to go on. I&#8217;m too
ill.&#8221;</p>

<p>Jane didn&#8217;t argue with her, but with the aid
of Miss Comstock, helped the passenger out of
the plane and into the cool, sweet night air.
It was then that she got her first good look at
the woman she was to care for on the trip to
Chicago.</p>

<p>Mrs. Van Verity Vanness was between
sixty-five and seventy. The cheeks were still
full and bore few wrinkles, but the hands gave
away the fact that Mrs. Van Verity Vanness
was well past middle age.</p>

<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t walk. Don&#8217;t make me,&#8221; she begged.</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll only take a few steps,&#8221; said Jane, her
own strong arms supporting the older woman.
&#8220;Breath deeply and enjoy the air. Don&#8217;t think
about flying.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But I&#8217;ve got to get to New York.&#8221; There
was a sob in the older woman&#8217;s voice, and she
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_110'></a>110</span>shuddered as she looked at the hulking tri-motor.
Even a thought of returning to the
plane struck terror into her heart.</p>

<p>Jane turned to Miss Comstock and whispered
a suggestion.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t let them start the motors until I give
the signal,&#8221; she said. &#8220;It may take quite a while
to get her calm, but once she&#8217;s back in the plane
I think I&#8217;ll be able to manage.&#8221;</p>

<p>Miss Comstock nodded and hurried away
while Jane guided her elderly passenger toward
the stewardess&#8217; quarters. There, well away
from the rush and confusion of the hangar, she
made her comfortable while she put a pot of
tea on the electric grill in the commissary.
Within five minutes Jane had tea and wafers
ready on a silver tray. She talked gaily about
everything except flying and Mrs. Van Verity
Vanness began to show a new interest in living.
The tea was delicious and the wafers were appetizing.
The wealthy passenger of the
special drank two cups of tea and ate five of the
wafers.</p>

<p>Jane heard a tap on the window and looked
up to see Charlie Fischer making horrible faces
at her and pointing toward his watch. The
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_111'></a>111</span>tri-motor was at least seven minutes late now.
Jane must do something at once.</p>

<p>She picked up the tea tray and started for the
commissary.</p>

<p>&#8220;If you could go with me, I might attempt
to continue the journey,&#8221; said Mrs. Van Verity
Vanness. &#8220;I can&#8217;t bear the thought of going on
alone.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But I am going with you,&#8221; replied Jane.
&#8220;Didn&#8217;t they tell you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No. Those pilots only flew faster and
faster and I got sicker and sicker.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll let them fly as fast as they want to,&#8221;
smiled Jane, &#8220;just as long as they have smooth
weather. There&#8217;s a delicious lunch, late papers
and some magazines aboard the plane now.
We&#8217;ll return to the hangar, make ourselves
comfortable in the plane, and tell them to go
ahead. We&#8217;ll be almost ten minutes late leaving
here.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll go on,&#8221; agreed the woman of millions,
&#8220;but only because you are going with me.&#8221;</p>

<p>Without showing too much haste, Jane
shepherded her passenger into the tri-motor.
Charlie Fischer, still looking at his watch, gave
her a black look as he climbed into the cockpit.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_112'></a>112</span>Jane made Mrs. Van Verity Vanness comfortable
in chair No. 6, and then stepped back
to the door where Miss Comstock was peering
in. &#8220;Everything all right?&#8221; asked the chief
stewardess.</p>

<p>&#8220;She&#8217;s perfectly calm now,&#8221; replied Jane.
&#8220;I&#8217;m sure we&#8217;ll make Chicago all right.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The general manager is fairly burning up
the radio trying to find out about the delay
here.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You can tell him that it took us the extra
time to persuade Mrs. Van Verity Vanness to
continue the trip,&#8221; said Jane.</p>

<p>&#8220;Good-bye and good luck,&#8221; said Miss Comstock
as she closed the door. Jane made sure
that the door was latched securely, stowed the
hamper of food away in the pantry, and then
hastened up to take a seat beside her passenger.</p>

<p>The motors roared and the plane quivered to
the pulse of their power. Mrs. Van Verity
Vanness paled as the plane rolled forward, but
Jane took the hands of the elderly woman and
held them in her own. Almost before they
knew it the plane was in the air, streaking away
into the east in the race to make up the lost
time.</p>

<div>
<a id='ch12'></a>

<p class='line mb2ch center'><i>Alarming News</i></p>
</div>

<p><span class='sc'>The</span> lights of Cheyenne faded rapidly as
Charlie Fischer gunned the big transport hard.
Jane, watching the air speed indicator, saw it
climb from 110 to 130. It hovered there for
several minutes and then started climbing again.
In less than fifteen minutes they were up 7,000
feet and with a good tail wind boomed along
at better than 150 miles an hour.</p>

<p>Jane looked at her elderly companion. Mrs.
Van Verity Vanness had her eyes closed tightly
and Jane spoke to her reassuringly.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a long ride to Chicago,&#8221; she said.
&#8220;Suppose we look through some magazines.
Then we&#8217;ll have a cup of bouillon and sandwiches
just before midnight and after that I&#8217;ll
tuck you in for the night.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Tuck me in for the night?&#8221; asked Mrs.
Van Verity Vanness. &#8220;Why, I&#8217;ll never be able
to sleep.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I think you will. You can unfasten your
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_114'></a>114</span>safety belt now and I&#8217;ll see what I can find in
the way of magazines.&#8221;</p>

<p>Jane returned a minute later with half a
dozen copies of the latest magazines. She adjusted
the reading light for her companion and
Mrs. Van Verity Vanness, seeing Jane so calm
and casual, forced herself to overcome the fear
of flying which had sickened her. She selected
a magazine from the armful Jane offered and
settled herself comfortably in her seat.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m really commencing to enjoy it,&#8221; she
smiled, &#8220;but there&#8217;s a bit of a draft around my
feet.&#8221;</p>

<p>Jane hurried back to the compartment
where a supply of warm, woolly blankets were
kept. Selecting a pretty grey and pink one
she wrapped it around the elderly woman&#8217;s
legs. With Mrs. Van Verity Vanness comfortable
and apparently satisfied for some time,
Jane opened the Cheyenne paper.</p>

<p>She halfway expected to find a front page
story on the dash across country of Mrs. Van
Verity Vanness in a special plane for almost
any activity of this multi-millionaire widow
was worth a half column of space. Instead,
Jane read the alarming news that a mail plane
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_115'></a>115</span>had been robbed early that morning by aerial
bandits. The ship, a Bertold single engined
plane, had been shot down in southeastern Iowa
on the Kansas City to Chicago run and more
than a hundred thousand in currency taken
from the registered mail pouch which it carried.
The pilot had been seriously wounded by the
two bandits, who had used a machine gun to
force the mail ship down.</p>

<p>Jane resolved right then and there to keep
all of the papers away from Mrs. Van Verity
Vanness. If aerial bandits were operating, it
was entirely within the realm of possibility for
them to attack a special chartered by a woman
as wealthy as her companion.</p>

<p>The tri-motor hurled through the night, the
speed increasing as Charlie Fischer pushed it up
another thousand feet to benefit by an even
stronger tail wind at that altitude. They
roared along at between 165 and 170 miles an
hour, nearly 50 miles above the usual cruising
speed of a plane of that type.</p>

<p>Below them winked the revolving beacons
which lighted the transcontinental airway at
night. Occasionally they sighted the dim
gleams from some prairie town.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_116'></a>116</span>Mrs. Van Verity Vanness let the magazine
drop into her lap as she closed her eyes, now
thoroughly relaxed and without fear of anything
happening to the plane. It was 11:30
and Jane leaned over and spoke to her companion.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll bring the bouillon and sandwiches right
away. Then you can go to sleep.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mrs. Van Verity Vanness nodded contentedly
and Jane went back to her pantry.</p>

<p>The bouillon, golden brown, smelled delicious
as it gurgled out of the thermos jug and
the sandwiches were almost paper thin with a
tasty filling of olives and salad dressing.</p>

<p>Jane put the lunch on a silver tray and carried
it into the cabin where she placed it on a
small portable table which she had put between
the seats.</p>

<p>&#8220;Several hours ago I thought I&#8217;d never be
able to eat again,&#8221; smiled the woman of millions,
&#8220;but this actually appeals to me.&#8221;</p>

<p>Jane agreed, for Miss Comstock had personally
prepared the lunch and it should be delicious.
The bouillon was expertly flavored
and the sandwiches were the kind that made
even the daintiest eaters hunger for more.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_117'></a>117</span>When the last sandwich had disappeared and
the second cup of bouillon was only a memory,
Mrs. Van Verity Vanness leaned back in her
chair and smiled happily.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re a wonder,&#8221; she told Jane. &#8220;I think
I&#8217;ll ask the company to send you clear through
to New York with me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Our division only goes to Chicago,&#8221; replied
Jane, &#8220;but I&#8217;d be delighted to go on if the
general manager approves.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I think he&#8217;ll approve if I ask it. After all,
I&#8217;m paying almost enough for this trip to buy
one of their planes.&#8221;</p>

<p>Jane removed the luncheon dishes, brought
another blanket, adjusted the seat at a reclining
angle and tucked Mrs. Van Verity Vanness
away for the night.</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll land at North Platte, Omaha, and
Iowa City,&#8221; she said, &#8220;but there&#8217;ll be no need
for you to disturb yourself. I&#8217;ll inquire for
messages at each stop and waken you if there
is any news.&#8221;</p>

<p>In less than five minutes Mrs. Van Verity
Vanness was sleeping soundly and Jane went
back to her pantry to stow away the dishes she
had used for their midnight lunch.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_118'></a>118</span>The flasher which signaled that the chief
pilot wanted to talk to her came on and Jane
walked ahead, careful not to disturb her passenger.
The stewardess made her way past the
baggage compartment and stuck her head in the
pilots&#8217; cockpit.</p>

<p>Charlie Fischer looked down at her.</p>

<p>&#8220;How&#8217;s our famous passenger?&#8221; he asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;Sound asleep,&#8221; replied Jane, &#8220;and she&#8217;ll
stay that way until morning if you&#8217;ll use a little
care in landing and taking off.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll drop this crate down like we were
carrying eggs,&#8221; promised Charlie, &#8220;but don&#8217;t
you let her out of the plane. Next time we
may never be able to get her back on board.&#8221;</p>

<p>Jane returned to the cabin where the only
light was the one over her seat at the rear. Her
passenger was sleeping soundly and Jane sat
down and relaxed.</p>

<p>The last two hours, from the time she had received
the call to rush to the field, had been
filled with a nervous tension. Handling Mrs.
Van Verity Vanness had required real tact
and patience and Jane had been so busy she
hadn&#8217;t had time to remember that this was her
first trip as stewardess. Up until now she had
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_119'></a>119</span>rather looked upon herself as a trained nurse
called in to care for a nervous, irritable woman.</p>

<p>At better than 8,000 feet the air was chilly
even in the summer and Jane got a blanket and
wrapped it around her shoulders. She didn&#8217;t
dare sleep for fear Mrs. Van Verity Vanness
would waken and call her.</p>

<p>Jane had hardly settled down to rest when
the lights of North Platte appeared far ahead
and the throbbing of the motors eased off.
Charlie Fischer set the plane down without a
bounce and they rolled into the hangar.</p>

<p>Mrs. Van Verity Vanness roused slightly
and Jane told her they were in North Platte.
The stop there took just a little better than four
minutes and Jane learned that there were no
messages for her passenger. Then they were
booming east again with the next stop at
Omaha.</p>

<p>Jane settled down in her chair, wondering if
her passenger had been serious when she mentioned
taking her on to New York. What a
lark that would be and how the other girls
would talk. Jane could just imagine Mattie
Clark turning almost green with envy.</p>

<p>The pilot found the favoring wind again and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_120'></a>120</span>they sped from North Platte to Omaha in
record time for the big tri-motor. At the
Omaha field reporters were waiting for the
plane and Jane was forced to go to the waiting
room and answer their questions, for Mrs. Van
Verity Vanness refused to see them,</p>

<p>For five minutes she fended off the questions
of the newspapermen, answering those she was
free to.</p>

<p>&#8220;Better look out for the aerial bandits,&#8221; they
warned her. &#8220;Think of the ransom they could
demand if they captured your passenger?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Haven&#8217;t they been captured?&#8221; asked Jane.</p>

<p>&#8220;No. They vanished after bringing down
the mail plane in southeastern Iowa. The last
report said that they had been heading west.
Of course, that was early yesterday. They&#8217;ve
landed at some out of the way field.&#8221;</p>

<p>Jane thanked the reporter and turned back
to the tri-motor, glad to get away from her
questioners lest she show them how much she
was disturbed. With the newspapers now
broadcasting the cross-country dash of the
wealthy Mrs. Van Verity Vanness, Jane knew
that the special was not safe with the aerial
bandits still at large.</p>

</div>

<p><span class='sc'>Just</span> before the tri-motor wheeled off the ramp
at Omaha, the radio operator at the field hurried
up with a message. It was from New
York, informing Mrs. Van Verity Vanness
that her son was slightly improved and was
looking forward to her arrival at his bedside.</p>

<p>The little woman of the many millions
looked at Jane through tear-dimmed eyes.</p>

<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s my only son,&#8221; she said. &#8220;He means
so very much to me.&#8221;</p>

<p>Jane nodded. She could understand, for in
her years of training at Good Samaritan she
had seen mother love put to many a severe and
heart-breaking test and she knew how deep in
a human soul it penetrated.</p>

<p>Reassured that her son was not losing
ground, Mrs. Van Verity Vanness dozed again
as the plane raced over western Iowa.</p>

<p>Jane went ahead to the pilots&#8217; cockpit and
leaned close to Charlie Fischer.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_122'></a>122</span>&#8220;The airplane bandits are still at large,&#8221; she
told him.</p>

<p>&#8220;I know it,&#8221; he said. &#8220;We got a special
warning at Omaha. A strange ship was sighted
over the Des Moines field half an hour ago and
it answered the description of the bandit craft.
Two army planes that were making an overnight
stop at Fort Des Moines have gone up to
see if they can trace it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Keep a close watch. I&#8217;ve got nearly a
billion-dollar piece of humanity in the cabin.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Orders are to land if we run into trouble.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But that would mean the capture and holding
of Mrs. Van Verity Vanness for ransom,&#8221;
protested Jane.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s better than having us all shot
down,&#8221; snapped Charlie. &#8220;You just mind
things in the cabin and I&#8217;ll run this end of the
ship.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; said Jane with finality. &#8220;If I were
a pilot and a bandit plane attacked me, I&#8217;d give
them a real race before I landed.&#8221;</p>

<p>Charlie started to reply but the co-pilot
grabbed his arm and pointed over to the right.
The lights of a plane, coming rapidly toward
them, were plainly visible.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_123'></a>123</span>Charlie looked at them for a second and
then snapped off the wing lights of his own
plane. &#8220;Get back into the cabin and turn off
the lights there,&#8221; he roared at Jane. &#8220;Here
comes trouble.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How do you know?&#8221; asked Jane.</p>

<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s no other ship but our own on this
division tonight and those lights coming toward
us aren&#8217;t the riding lights on a night
hawk.&#8221;</p>

<p>Jane departed on the run, and snapped off
the light in the cabin. It would be dawn in another
half hour, but for the coming thirty
minutes the tri-motor, running without lights,
had a chance of escaping the other plane.</p>

<p>The motors labored under a full charge of
gas as the big ship rocketed along at 170 miles
an hour. Once or twice the needle on the
speed dial mounted above the 170 mark, but
Charlie couldn&#8217;t hold it there.</p>

<p>Jane watched the lights of the other plane.
They didn&#8217;t appear to be any nearer. Perhaps
the bandits, after spotting their quarry,
would be content to wait until dawn and then
make a quick thrust.</p>

<p>The stewardess wondered if the pursuing
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_124'></a>124</span>plane was radio equipped for even as she left
the pilots&#8217; cockpit, the co-pilot had been pouring
out a warning of their danger.</p>

<p>It was nerve-racking business as Charlie
Fischer piloted the tri-motor with all of the
skill of his big hands. In and out of clouds
they dodged, now at 8,000 feet, and again at
6,000, but always the relentless pursuit was
with them. The sky lightened and Jane knew
that the crisis was near. She wanted to go
ahead and talk with Charlie and the co-pilot,
but she didn&#8217;t dare leave her passenger.</p>

<p>Mrs. Van Verity Vanness yawned and
threw off the blanket which had shielded her
shoulders. She sat up and looked out into the
gray light. Jane answered her summons.</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re having company,&#8221; said Mrs. Van
Verity Vanness, pointing toward the other
ship, a black biplane, which had drawn near.</p>

<p>Jane didn&#8217;t dare tell her the truth about the
other plane.</p>

<p>&#8220;Just some pilot up early,&#8221; she said lightly,
but her heart was far from feeling that way.</p>

<p>Their own plane dove sharply, and Mrs.
Van Verity Vanness gasped and clutched the
arms of her seat.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_125'></a>125</span>&#8220;The morning air is a bit rough at times,&#8221;
explained Jane reassuringly, but she knew all
of the time that the quick dive had been a
maneuver of Charlie&#8217;s to give them more time.
She wondered about the army planes which
had taken off from Des Moines. If their radio
was working, they should arrive soon.</p>

<p>&#8220;The pilot of that plane&#8217;s acting queerly,&#8221;
said Mrs. Van Verity Vanness. &#8220;He seems to
be waving at us.&#8221;</p>

<p>The light was better and Jane looked at the
black biplane. Mrs. Van Verity Vanness was
right. They were being waved down and
Jane&#8217;s heart went sick as she saw the snout of
a machine gun sticking over the nose of the
other craft. If Charlie refused to comply with
the order, it was plain they would be the target
for machine-gun bullets.</p>

<p>Jane looked at the altimeter with sinking
heart. They were down to 7,000 feet and
dropping lower steadily. She scanned the
country below for some sign of a city. There
were plenty of small towns within range, but
no large ones where an adequate police force
could be assembled to aid them.</p>

<p>Mrs. Van Verity Vanness did not appear
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_126'></a>126</span>alarmed. Charlie stalled at 5,000 feet and Jane
saw the pilot of the other plane wave at them
angrily.</p>

<p>It was agonizing, for Jane knew that once
they were on the ground there would be no
chance of escape. Her passenger would be
whisked away in the black plane, to be held
for a fabulous ransom and a desperately ill man
in New York would be without the sympathy
of his mother at his bedside to help him through
his illness.</p>

<p>They were down to 3,000 feet and Charlie
Fischer was hunting a good place to set down
when death roared down out of the sky.</p>

<p>Two army planes, their machine guns spitting
flame, hurled themselves at the black biplane.</p>

<p>Motors roaring wide open, pilots tense at the
triggers, the avenging army craft arrived just
as Charlie nosed the tri-motor down for a landing.</p>

<p>Mrs. Van Verity Vanness watched the scene
with startled eyes and Jane&#8217;s heart pounded
doubly fast.</p>

<p>The bandit plane was trapped between the
army ships. Bullets ripped through the wings
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_127'></a>127</span>of the black craft as the pilot tried desperately
to maneuver into position where the gunner
in his forward cockpit could get his weapon
into action.</p>

<p>&#8220;What does it mean?&#8221; gasped Jane&#8217;s passenger.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a bandit plane that shot down a mail
ship early yesterday in southeastern Iowa,&#8221; explained
the stewardess.</p>

<p>&#8220;But why was it following us? This plane
had no mail.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It had you, which was vastly more important.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ransom?&#8221;</p>

<p>Jane nodded.</p>

<p>&#8220;How long have you known we were in
danger?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ever since we caught sight of the black
plane. We had a description of it at Omaha
and were warned by radio to be on the lookout.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But you didn&#8217;t say a word to me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There was no need to alarm you.&#8221;</p>

<p>The army planes were closing in on their
quarry, darting in and out as the pilots directed
blasts of fire at the bandit craft. The aerial
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_128'></a>128</span>desperadoes knew that they could hope for
no quarter and they made one final attempt to
escape, heading their plane in a mad dive toward
one of the army ships.</p>

<p>But the dive laid them open to the fire of the
second army flyer, and he plunged down from
above, his machine gun spitting flame. Bullets
traced through the wing of the black biplane,
shattering the propeller. Then the left
wing of the biplane tore loose and the ship
fluttered aimlessly for a moment before nosing
down for the final plunge.</p>

<p>Mrs. Van Verity Vanness cried out in horror
and Jane placed her hands over the older woman&#8217;s
eyes. Finally the passenger turned from
the window and looked at Jane.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re a brave, sweet girl,&#8221; she said.
&#8220;Now I think I&#8217;ll rest again.&#8221;</p>

<p>Neither one mentioned the aerial duel they
had witnessed as the special roared on to the
pace of its quickened motors.</p>

<p>Jane prepared breakfast and while her
passenger sipped the hot chocolate, the stewardess
went up to the pilots&#8217; cockpit.</p>

<p>&#8220;Some dog fight,&#8221; said Charlie Fischer.
&#8220;Those army boys showed up just in time.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_129'></a>129</span>&#8220;I suppose I should say it was terrible,&#8221; said
Jane, &#8220;but knowing what those bandits would
have done to my passenger, I feel they got just
what was coming to them.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;They had time to repent all of their sins on
the way down,&#8221; admitted Charlie. &#8220;Say,
we&#8217;re skipping Des Moines. Got plenty of
fuel to take us to Iowa City.&#8221;</p>

<p>When they landed in the eastern Iowa city,
another message from New York reassured
Mrs. Van Verity Vanness and she read most of
the way into Chicago.</p>

<p>When they rolled up to the ramp of the
Chicago field, Jane suggested that her passenger
step out and walk a bit.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll feel much better,&#8221; she assured her.</p>

<p>Mrs. Van Verity Vanness agreed and Jane
assisted her out of the plane. Reporters were
clamoring at the gate, but a cordon of police
kept them from the field.</p>

<p>Charlie Fischer grinned as he went by.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m going over and be a hero,&#8221; he chuckled,
nodding toward the cameramen and reporters,
who were hungry for the story of the escape
from the bandits.</p>

<p>The short, stocky figure of Hubert Speidel,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_130'></a>130</span>personnel director of Federated Airways,
emerged from the crowd and came toward
them. He beckoned to Jane and she left her
passenger for a moment.</p>

<p>&#8220;Everything all right?&#8221; asked the personnel
chief anxiously.</p>

<p>&#8220;She seems to be enjoying the trip now,&#8221; replied
Jane, &#8220;but she wants a stewardess to continue
with her.&#8221;</p>

<p>Just then Mrs. Van Verity Vanness took
matters into her own hands.</p>

<p>&#8220;I presume you are a company official,&#8221; she
said, addressing the director. He nodded.</p>

<p>&#8220;Please inform your general manager that
I insist upon this young woman accompanying
me to New York. She has done everything
possible to make me comfortable and
without her assistance I would have been unable
to continue from Cheyenne.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But Miss Cameron&#8217;s division ends here,&#8221;
protested the personnel chief. &#8220;We&#8217;ll have to
put another stewardess aboard here.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t care a snap about divisions,&#8221; said
the woman of millions. &#8220;I want this stewardess.
Remember, there are other lines east of
Chicago.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_131'></a>131</span>The personnel director promised to do what
he could and hastened away. He was back in
less than five minutes.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a little irregular,&#8221; he said, &#8220;but Miss
Cameron can go through to New York with
with you.&#8221;</p>

<p>Fresh supplies were brought out and placed
in the pantry, Jane checking each item, for
they would have lunch at noon aboard the
plane and possibly a light supper just before
they reached New York.</p>

<p>A new crew of flyers took charge and exactly
fifteen minutes after landing, the special
roared away, with an entire nation watching its
progress, for newspaper presses were spewing
out extras by the thousands, telling the story of
the attempt to abduct Jane&#8217;s passenger.</p>

</div>

<p><span class='sc'>The</span> day was clear and warm, a beautiful
June-time, and the special was soon speeding
over the flat country of northern Indiana.
There was only one stop scheduled between
Chicago and New York, that at Cleveland,
where the tanks would be filled with fuel.</p>

<p>Jane prepared an appetizing lunch and Mrs.
Van Verity Vanness ate it with evident relish
as they skirted the south shore of Lake Erie.
That over, she insisted that Jane explain how
she had happened to join the air line.</p>

<p>The elderly woman was a good listener and
Jane told in detail of her last day at Good Samaritan
and how Miss Hardy had recommended
her for the position with the Federated
Airways.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d never heard of stewardesses on the
planes until you came aboard at Cheyenne,&#8221;
said Mrs. Van Verity Vanness. &#8220;Have you
been flying long?&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_133'></a>133</span>Jane smiled for her passenger was going to
be in for a surprise.</p>

<p>&#8220;This is my first regular trip,&#8221; she confessed.
&#8220;All of the girls go into service tomorrow.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then I predict a fine future for you.
Why, I thought you were a veteran of hundreds
of miles of flying.&#8221;</p>

<p>It was a sincere compliment and Jane glowed
inwardly. She had been so anxious to make a
good impression on her first flight.</p>

<p>At Cleveland another message from New
York reassured Mrs. Van Verity Vanness and
again she was shielded from reporters. No one
was allowed out on the ramp, but cameras
clicked as Jane stepped out of the cabin for a
breath of air. Then they were racing eastward
again, with the next stop the Newark airport.</p>

<p>They flew high over the rugged Alleghenies
and then dropped down over Jersey
toward the metropolis. The end of the long
flight was near and Jane felt greatly relieved.</p>

<p>Mrs. Van Verity Vanness summoned her as
they swung over the Newark airport.</p>

<p>&#8220;Wouldn&#8217;t you like to join me, traveling as
my nurse and companion?&#8221; she asked.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_134'></a>134</span>It was a question that left Jane speechless.
She had never considered such a possibility.</p>

<p>&#8220;As soon as my son is well, I plan to leave on
a round-the-world trip. We would be gone
a year.&#8221;</p>

<p>It was a tempting offer, almost irresistible,
but the zest of flying was deep in Jane and she
shook her head.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t believe I would be happy leaving
the air line now,&#8221; she said. &#8220;There seems to be
a real future for girls in aviation and I want to
make the most of my opportunity.&#8221;</p>

<p>The other woman sighed. &#8220;I was afraid
that would be your answer and you are probably
right. But I&#8217;ve grown dreadfully fond
of you. If there is anything I can do at any
time, don&#8217;t hesitate to call on me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Thank you,&#8221; said Jane.</p>

<p>The plane rolled to a stop in the Newark
hangar of the Federated line and a huge limousine
with two motorcycle officers flanking
it, drew up to the cabin door.</p>

<p>&#8220;Goodbye, my dear,&#8221; said Mrs. Van Verity
Vanness as she stepped into the limousine to be
whirled away toward New York to the tune
of screaming sirens.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_135'></a>135</span>Jane was a little breathless. It had been such
an exciting trip all the way from Cheyenne.
Now she wondered just when she would start
back. An official hurried toward her.</p>

<p>&#8220;Reporters are almost tearing the waiting
room to pieces,&#8221; he said. &#8220;They couldn&#8217;t see
Mrs. Van Verity Vanness but they insist on
talking with you. You&#8217;d better tell them what
happened this morning.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But I don&#8217;t know what to say,&#8221; protested
Jane.</p>

<p>&#8220;Just answer their questions.&#8221;</p>

<p>In the waiting room a dozen men of assorted
ages, and three women, awaited Jane. The
moment she entered they started firing questions
at her.</p>

<p>&#8220;How had Mrs. Van Verity Vanness acted
when the bandit plane swooped down on
them? How had Jane felt? What had she
served her passenger at mealtime? Had Mrs.
Van Verity Vanness commented on the financial
situation?&#8221;</p>

<p>It was a steady barrage and Jane&#8217;s head
whirled as she tried to answer them all. Finally
she threw up her hands and sank down in a
chair in despair.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_136'></a>136</span>&#8220;Can&#8217;t you see I&#8217;m all tired out?&#8221; she cried.
&#8220;Please let me alone.&#8221;</p>

<p>She buried her head in her arms and her body
shook with the sobs of nervous exhaustion for
the strain of the long flight and caring for the
wealthy passenger had been more than Jane
had realized.</p>

<p>&#8220;She&#8217;s a plucky kid,&#8221; she heard one reporter
say as the newspaper people trooped out of the
room.</p>

<p>In a few minutes Jane felt more composed
and she went into the operations office.</p>

<p>&#8220;What time do I start west?&#8221; she asked the
chief dispatcher.</p>

<p>&#8220;All of the space is taken until the 8:18
west in the morning. You&#8217;d better take a cab
to a hotel and get some sleep.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then Jane remembered that she was without
funds. It was their first pay day in Cheyenne,
but she was hundreds of miles from there.</p>

<p>&#8220;I guess I&#8217;ll just wait here until the plane
goes,&#8221; she said.</p>

<p>The dispatcher was busy and failed to notice
Jane&#8217;s fatigue or he might have guessed that
she was in an embarrassing situation. Jane
washed her face and hands and walked outside
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_137'></a>137</span>to watch the sun go down behind the Jersey
hills.</p>

<p>She was hungry, but the tri-motor she had
come in on had been trundled away to a distant
hangar and there was little chance that
she could find it and rummage through the
pantry for anything to eat.</p>

<p>Jane skimmed through the magazines in the
waiting room and selected one on aviation.
She had hardly settled herself when a young
woman burst into the room.</p>

<p>&#8220;Where&#8217;s Jane Cameron?&#8221; demanded the
newcomer.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m Jane Cameron,&#8221; replied the stewardess.</p>

<p>&#8220;What a break! I&#8217;m Ruthe Harrigan,
special writer for the <i>New York Globe</i>. Late
as usual in getting my assignment. Afraid I
had missed you. How about your story?
Sold it to anyone yet?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, no,&#8221; stammered the surprised Jane.
&#8220;I talked to a number of reporters but they
didn&#8217;t say anything about paying me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;They wouldn&#8217;t,&#8221; snorted the newcomer.
&#8220;Let&#8217;s hop outside and get a bite to eat. Then
we&#8217;ll make a deal for your first-person story
of the battle with the bandits.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_138'></a>138</span>Ruthe Harrigan led Jane to a comfortable
restaurant only a block from the hangar and
after sizzling steaks had been served, plied Jane
with questions.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m after a first-person story of what happened
on your trip in,&#8221; she explained. &#8220;We&#8217;ll
pay you well for permission to use your name
above the story.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But what would Mrs. Van Verity Vanness
and company officials say?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll call the Federated publicity office,&#8221; said
the energetic Ruthe. Jane talked to the New
York publicity head of Federated, and he approved
of the story. Another call to Mrs. Van
Verity Vanness brought her consent.</p>

<p>&#8220;Make them pay a good price,&#8221; she advised
Jane.</p>

<p>Dinner over, they hastened back to the Federated
hangar where the reporter borrowed a
typewriter. &#8220;Now tell me everything that
happened and how you felt.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But we haven&#8217;t agreed on a price,&#8221; said
Jane.</p>

<p>&#8220;How about $50?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That doesn&#8217;t seem enough. Won&#8217;t this
be front page news?&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_139'></a>139</span>&#8220;I should say it will. Every other New
York paper will probably turn green with
envy.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then $50 isn&#8217;t enough.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I might be able to get $100,&#8221; urged the reporter.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t take less than $500,&#8221; advised the
night dispatcher. &#8220;If the <i>Globe</i> won&#8217;t pay it,
call some of the other papers. They will.&#8221;</p>

<p>In desperation, Ruthe Harrigan called her
editor and before Jane gave her a line of copy,
a check for $500 was in the hands of the stewardess.</p>

<p>It was more money than Jane had ever had
before and she fingered the check carefully.
Now she could go to a hotel, have the finest
room, enjoy the choicest food, and still have
what to her was wealth.</p>

<p>For two hours Ruthe Harrigan plied her
with questions while she beat a heavy tattoo on
the typewriter. When she was through she
had nine pages of copy to send to her office.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a good story,&#8221; smiled the reporter,
&#8220;even if you did make us pay through the nose
for it.&#8221;</p>

<p>Jane cashed her check at the field and had it
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_140'></a>140</span>converted into travelers&#8217; checks of small denominations.
Then she took a taxi to a recommended
hotel and by 11 o&#8217;clock was sound
asleep, while across the river in New York the
presses of the <i>Globe</i> were rolling out her own
story of the encounter with the aerial bandits.</p>

<p class='line mb2ch center'><i>&#8220;Hello Heroine&#8221;</i></p>
</div>

<p><span class='sc'>Jane</span> was up at seven the next morning and
a few minutes later, went down to breakfast.
In the lobby she purchased copies of all of the
morning papers and went into the grill for
breakfast.</p>

<p>An excellent picture of herself stared up
from the front page of the <i>Globe</i> and underneath
the picture was a two column headline
informing <i>Globe</i> readers that they were about
to read Jane Cameron&#8217;s own story of the battle
with the bandits.</p>

<p>Jane flushed and looked up to make sure no
one had recognized her. But there were only
a few at breakfast at that hour and she read the
story from opening paragraph to the final dash.
Jane had to admit that Ruthe Harrigan had
done an excellent job of writing. The story
was thrilling, from start to finish.</p>

<p>After breakfast Jane bought half a dozen
copies of the <i>Globe</i>, paid her hotel bill, and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_142'></a>142</span>took a taxi to the field. A pass was ready for
her and the 8:18 was on the line, warming up
for the trip west.</p>

<p>A messenger approached Jane with a message
and she signed for it. Inside was a brief
note from Mrs. Van Verity Vanness expressing
her appreciation and with it a check, &#8220;a little
token of my gratitude,&#8221; wrote Jane&#8217;s passenger.
The stewardess&#8217; eyes blinked as she
looked at the check. It was for one thousand
dollars!</p>

<p>Jane&#8217;s knees felt weak and she grasped a
nearby handrail for support. A thousand dollars!
Why, it didn&#8217;t seem possible. But it was
possible, for a thousand dollars was only pin
money to the millions which Mrs. Van Verity
Vanness controlled.</p>

<p>Jane felt almost uncomfortably rich. There
had been $500 for selling the story and now the
thousand dollar check. She had spent less than
$10 for her room, breakfast, taxi fare and the
papers. Why she would have at the very least
$1,490 when she returned to Cheyenne. It
seemed unbelievable but she had the checks.</p>

<p>The day chief of operations at Newark came
up.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_143'></a>143</span>&#8220;There&#8217;s a sound crew from a news reel outside.
They want you to pose and say a few
words. It&#8217;s good publicity for the line.&#8221;</p>

<p>Jane was glad that it was almost time for the
plane to depart, for facing a movie camera was
a real ordeal. Her mouth went dry and chills
ran along her back as the sound man held the
microphone close. Somehow she managed to
say a few words, and then she hurried back to
the 8:18. Two minutes later the big tri-motor
was roaring west, and late that night Jane
would be back at Cheyenne.</p>

<p>There was a strong headwind and they seldom
got above a hundred miles an hour, with
the result that they were more than an hour
late when they reached Chicago.</p>

<p>Jane changed planes there and had a lunch at
the field. Then the tri-motor sped westward
again. There was a light passenger list, only
nine aboard the fourteen-passenger craft, and
none of them recognized Jane, for which she
was grateful.</p>

<p>Night came as they roared over the rich farm
lands of Iowa and from Omaha west, Jane
dozed, lulled by the rhythmic beating of the
three great engines.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_144'></a>144</span>The wind increased in force as they neared
the Rockies, and the speed was well under a
hundred an hour. As a result, it was nearly
three o&#8217;clock when the lights of Cheyenne
showed far ahead, under the left wing. Jane
roused herself and straightened her uniform.
She wondered if the girls would be at the field.</p>

<p>The big plane glided noiselessly out of the
night into the glare of the floodlights. When
it rolled into the hangar Jane peered anxiously
toward the waiting room. Sure enough, Sue,
Grace and Alice were there, all of them fairly
dancing in their anxiety to greet her.</p>

<p>The young stewardess was first out of the
tri-motor, and she ran to meet her friends.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hello heroine,&#8221; said Sue, as she threw her
arms around Jane in an affectionate embrace.</p>

<p>&#8220;Welcome home,&#8221; added Alice, while
Grace added, &#8220;let&#8217;s see what the New York
papers said about you.&#8221;</p>

<p>Miss Comstock, who had been in the background,
came up and greeted Jane warmly.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ve done a wonderful piece of work
for the stewardess service,&#8221; she said. &#8220;Mrs.
Van Verity Vanness sent the general manager
a long telegram today, highly recommending
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_145'></a>145</span>the service and especially complimenting you.
I&#8217;m sure that as a result of your outstanding
work, we&#8217;re all assured of jobs for a long time
to come.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But I didn&#8217;t do anything unusual,&#8221; protested
Jane. &#8220;I simply did my job as I had
been trained to do it, in the hospital and here at
the field. It was nothing more than what will
soon be routine to every one of us.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not every one of us will have bandits attack
our plane the first time we&#8217;re out, nor will
we be carrying a woman who can sign her
name to a check for a million dollars and know
that she can cash it,&#8221; put in Grace.</p>

<p>Jane looked at her wrist watch. It was just
three o&#8217;clock.</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;d better hurry home if we plan to get
any sleep tonight,&#8221; she said.</p>

<p>&#8220;You can go home,&#8221; said Grace, &#8220;but Alice
and I are ordered out on the eastbound mail.
It&#8217;s coming through in two sections from the
coast this morning, and will be here in another
fifteen minutes.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then I&#8217;ll stay and see you off,&#8221; said Jane.
&#8220;Fifteen minutes, more or less, won&#8217;t make
much difference at this time of night.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_146'></a>146</span>Miss Comstock was busy in the commissary,
checking supplies which were to go aboard the
eastbound planes and the girls all lent her a
hand.</p>

<p>They plied Jane with questions about the
trip, the encounter with the bandits, and how
she had gotten along with Mrs. Van Verity
Vanness.</p>

<p>&#8220;She&#8217;s an old dear,&#8221; said Jane. &#8220;I don&#8217;t care
what the newspapers say about her, she certainly
treated me splendidly, and just as we got
to New York she invited me to accompany her
as nurse and companion. She&#8217;s planning a
round-the-world trip as soon as her son recovers.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And you turned that down?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I should say I did. Why, I wouldn&#8217;t trade
this job of mine for almost anything else in the
world. You&#8217;ll feel the same way before you&#8217;re
half way through your first regular flight as
stewardess. There&#8217;s a thrill to flying that can&#8217;t
be found in anything else.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m willing to be shown,&#8221; said Grace.</p>

<p>The planes from the west came in on time,
both of them loaded to capacity. New crews
took over the controls at Cheyenne and Grace
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_147'></a>147</span>and Alice stowed the food away in the pantries.
They checked their passenger lists and when
the planes were refueled, called their passengers
aboard.</p>

<p>&#8220;Good luck,&#8221; called Jane and Sue as they
stood on the ramp and watched the big ships
wheel out of the hangar. Then the planes
roared away into a greying sky, which heralded
the coming of another dawn.</p>

<p>A field car was available to take them to
town and Miss Comstock joined them.</p>

<p>&#8220;Are you going to come out and see every
ship off?&#8221; asked Jane.</p>

<p>&#8220;I should say not, but with all of the girls assigned
to go out within the next 24 hours, I
want to see that they get started right. After
that, they&#8217;ll be on their own.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What assignment do we get?&#8221; asked Sue.</p>

<p>&#8220;You will be on the <i>Night Flyer</i> while Jane
is to take the <i>Coast to Coast Limited</i>. You&#8217;ll go
out tonight, while Jane&#8217;s first trip is tomorrow
morning.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then I&#8217;ll plan to do plenty of sleeping in
the next few hours,&#8221; said Sue. &#8220;The <i>Night
Flyer</i> means a slow trip to Chicago for it stops
at every airport.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_148'></a>148</span>Mrs. Murphy heard them come in, and appeared
with her hair done up in curl papers and
a faded kimono wrapped around her ample
bulk. She insisted on going down and fixing
a lunch, and over the kitchen table Jane spread
out the New York papers. They read the
stories, in great detail, and Mrs. Murphy appeared
immensely pleased at the great publicity
given to Jane&#8217;s fine work.</p>

<p>&#8220;I could tell the minute I laid eyes on you,
that you&#8217;d be a winner,&#8221; she said proudly.
&#8220;Now you&#8217;d best both be off to bed, for it&#8217;s
circles you&#8217;ll be having under your eyes if you
don&#8217;t.&#8221;</p>

<p>They thanked Mrs, Murphy for the lunch
and hurried upstairs to undress and crawl between
crisp, cool sheets just as the sun came
over the horizon.</p>

<p>Mrs. Murphy came in later and adjusted the
curtains on the porch, and the girls slept until
mid-afternoon.</p>

<p>Sue, about to make her first flight alone, was
nervous and excited. She fussed over the way
her uniform fitted her trim figure and worried
about what she would do if any of the passengers
became ill.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_149'></a>149</span>&#8220;Just forget you&#8217;re in a plane and think
about ward duty back in Good Samaritan, then
you&#8217;ll know what to do,&#8221; advised Jane.</p>

<p>They had supper with Mrs. Murphy and
then a car from the field called for them. The
<i>Night Flyer</i> was due at ten o&#8217;clock, but Sue
had at least an hour&#8217;s work in the commissary
and she wanted to have plenty of time.</p>

<p>Miss Comstock, looking rather worn and
tired, was still on duty and Mattie Clark was
also at the field, looking very neat and business-like
in her uniform.</p>

<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s two sections tonight on the <i>Flyer</i>,&#8221;
Mattie informed Sue. &#8220;I&#8217;m going out on the
first section and you&#8217;ll take the second.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Sue is assigned on the first section,&#8221; said
Miss Comstock, who resented Mattie&#8217;s infringement
of her authority. &#8220;You take
No. 2.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But I want to be in Chicago early,&#8221; protested
Mattie.</p>

<p>&#8220;Both ships will be there within five minutes
of each other. Besides, Sue is to be on the
<i>Flyer</i> regularly, and she might just as well get
acquainted with the regular pilots who are on
that run.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_150'></a>150</span>Mattie was silent, but it was obvious that
she was anything but pleased at Miss Comstock&#8217;s
decision, and Jane knew more than
ever, that Mattie was going to cause trouble
for everyone else in the ranks of the stewardess
corps.</p>

<div>
<a id='ch16'></a>
<p class='line mt3ch center'><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_151'></a>151</span><span class='sc'>Chapter Sixteen</span></p>
<p class='line mb2ch center'><i>Through the Fog</i></p>
</div>

<p><span class='sc'>The</span> first section of the <i>Night Flier</i>  came
in from the west three minutes ahead of schedule
and with a capacity load. While the
passengers stretched their legs and visited about
the flight over the mountains from Salt Lake,
Sue stowed her kit away in the pantry.</p>

<p>With departure time at hand, she forgot the
nervousness which had gripped her earlier and
became a calm, self-contained nurse.</p>

<p>&#8220;The best of luck,&#8221; whispered Jane as she
squeezed her friend&#8217;s hand.</p>

<p>Sue herded her passengers into the cabin and
closed the door. The landing stage was
wheeled away and the <i>Night Flyer</i> lumbered
out of the hangar on the first lap of the long
flight to Chicago.</p>

<p>Jane watched the lights of the plane until
they were pin-points in the east.</p>

<p>It was Sue&#8217;s task to make her passengers
comfortable for the night and she went along
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_152'></a>152</span>the aisle, adjusting seats, turning off lights,
and bringing out the thick, warm blankets
from the supply closet. In half an hour she
had the task completed and only one passenger,
an elderly man, had elected to read, selecting a
Cheyenne paper with the latest news.</p>

<p>As they sped east, Sue wondered at her own
nervousness which had been so evident before
the flight. Now everything seemed so matter-of-fact.
She felt as though she had been flying
for years.</p>

<p>A woman who had come through from
&#8217;Frisco was getting off at North Platte and Sue
roused her just before they swooped down on
the field. In ten minutes they were away
again, with a radio order to stop at Grand
Island to pick up a passenger for Chicago and
another coast passenger would disembark at
Lincoln.</p>

<p>The <i>Night Flyer</i> made most of the local
stops, and as a result was anything but popular
with the pilots. Most of the new men on the
line drew the thankless job of piloting the
<i>Flyer</i>, and the crew of Sue&#8217;s ship had been on
only a little more than a month.</p>

<p>With a fair tail wind, they kept on time despite
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_153'></a>153</span>all of their stops, and they soared away
from Omaha and over the muddy Missouri a
few minutes after two a.m. with a new crew
of pilots up ahead. The stewardesses made the
entire trip from Cheyenne to Chicago, but the
pilots changed at Omaha, unless piloting a
special.</p>

<p>It was over this stretch of the line that Jane
had encountered the thrilling experience
which had brought her front page fame in
every newspaper in the country and Sue looked
out, halfway in the hope that something unusual
enough to bring her fame, would happen.</p>

<p>But her hopes were doomed, and they went
into Des Moines on time. The only field they
missed was at Iowa City, and they sped over
that one shortly after sunrise.</p>

<p>East of the Mississippi, they lost the sun in
a murk of smoke and fog.</p>

<p>Sue&#8217;s light flashed, and she went forward to
answer the call from the chief pilot.</p>

<p>&#8220;Weather around Chicago&#8217;s bad,&#8221; he said.
&#8220;We may not be able to get through, so stall
the passengers off if they get anxious about the
time we&#8217;re due in Chicago.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But what will I tell them?&#8221; asked Sue.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_154'></a>154</span>&#8220;That&#8217;s your job. All I do is run this crate.&#8221;</p>

<p>Like Jane, Sue was finding out that pilots
who on the ground were the pleasantest and
most friendly flyers, were more than likely to
be martinets when they were at the controls of
a big passenger plane.</p>

<p>Sue took the rebuff good naturedly. Of
course it was her job to keep the passengers
from being alarmed.</p>

<p>Franklin Grove was the last of the emergency
landing fields she saw, before the &#8220;soup&#8221;
swallowed them and they looked out into a
solid wall of rushing grey, so thick it almost
hid the wings.</p>

<p>Passengers looked anxiously toward Sue,
and one or two of them summoned her. To
their questions, she replied as truthfully as she
could that they had struck a bit of bad weather,
but that the radio beacon was guiding the pilot
and they expected to soon be out of the fog and
into clear weather.</p>

<p>That explanation satisfied them for the first
half hour, but after that Sue found herself in
trouble and a rising fear gripping her own
heart. The questions the passengers asked
were more difficult to answer.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_155'></a>155</span>Why weren&#8217;t they out of the fog? They
were late now getting into Chicago. Did the
pilot know where he was? Why couldn&#8217;t they
land and wait for the bad weather to clear?</p>

<p>Sue answered them as best she could and
tried to remain calm, putting on the best professional
manner of a trained nurse.</p>

<p>Her signal light glowed again and she went
forward. The chief pilot looked years older.</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re in trouble,&#8221; he told her frankly.
&#8220;I&#8217;ve lost my radio bearings and the gas is getting
low. Have your passengers fasten their
safety belts and see that there is no smoking.
If we crash we don&#8217;t want any extra risk of
fire.&#8221;</p>

<p>Sue returned to the cabin, hoping desperately
that her face would not give away the
gravity of their situation when she asked the
passengers to put on their safety belts. She
went from one to another, adjusting the belts,
and informing them that they were about to
land, but she didn&#8217;t add that it was likely to be
a crash landing. When everyone was fastened
to the seats, Sue reported to the chief pilot.</p>

<p>&#8220;Get back in the cabin. We&#8217;re going
down,&#8221; he said curtly.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_156'></a>156</span>Sue watched the altimeter.. The needle
dropped gently from the 3,000 feet at which
they had been flying, but the wall of fog still
enveloped the earth.</p>

<p>They nosed through it carefully, the air
speed cut down to a hundred miles an hour.
Even that speed was a terrific one at which
to crash into the ground. Sue was too busy
thinking about her passengers to sense her own
emotions.</p>

<p>For five minutes the pilot groped his way
down and suddenly the nose of the big ship
shot through the fog. The plane flattened out
200 feet above the ground and skimmed along
over farmhouses with the motors roaring
heavily.</p>

<p>Suddenly the ship heeled over and for a sickening
instant, Sue thought they were crashing
until she caught sight of an airport and knew
the pilot was sliding in for a fast landing.</p>

<p>As the plane touched the ground the motors
sucked the last fuel from the tanks. The tri-motor
rolled up to the hangar and Sue looked
at the name painted above the large doors.
They had come down at Joliet, nearly thirty
miles south of their course.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_157'></a>157</span>The pilot came back.</p>

<p>&#8220;Weather&#8217;s still bad around Chicago,&#8221; he
announced. &#8220;We&#8217;ll have taxis here in a few
minutes to take you in.&#8221;</p>

<p>Sue helped her passengers collect their hand
baggage and sheperded them into the taxis.
In half an hour the last one was safely away for
Chicago, and Sue had time to sit down and have
a little cry all by herself.</p>

<p>They remained at Joliet until mid-afternoon,
when the fog cleared and they
hopped the short distance to the field at Chicago.
It was then that Sue learned that the
second section of the <i>Night Flyer</i> was down
at Sterling, Illinois, with the weather west of
Chicago still foggy and little chance of it clearing
before mid-evening. Sue could imagine
the wrath of Mattie Clark, who had been anxious
to reach Chicago that morning.</p>

<p>Sue went to the office of the personnel director
to be assigned quarters while in Chicago
and learned that the line had leased two apartments
nearby which would accommodate eight
girls. They could cook their own meals there
or go out to restaurants as they preferred, since
the line&#8217;s only obligation was to domicile them
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_158'></a>158</span>while at the Chicago end of their runs.</p>

<p>&#8220;I talked with some of the passengers who
came as far as Joliet with you,&#8221; said the personnel
chief, &#8220;and they gave me some fine reports
of your calmness. I feel that I owe Miss
Hardy at Good Samaritan a letter of real appreciation
for the girls she recommended.&#8221;</p>

<p>After leaving the personnel office, Sue
looked at the bulletin board. The <i>Coast to
Coast Limited</i> with Jane aboard would be in at
five o&#8217;clock and she decided to wait for her.</p>

<p>Sue enjoyed a late lunch at the restaurant
and then walked out on the ramp to watch the
arrival and departure of the planes.</p>

<p>A crimson monoplane was being loaded for
a run to Kansas City, while a trim, blue biplane
was waiting for four passengers for Detroit.
It all seemed so matter-of-fact, and Sue knew
that after her flight through the fog that morning
she would never again be afraid of flying.</p>

</div>

<p><span class='sc'>Sue</span> met Jane when she stepped off the
<i>Coast to Coast Limited</i> and together the girls
went to the apartments which had been leased
by the air line. They were in Chicago for the
night. Sue booked out early the next morning
and Jane later in the day.</p>

<p>Grace and Alice, also in Chicago, had been
down town shopping that afternoon, but they
all met at the apartment. There was an attractive
kitchenette, but the girls were tired and
they had dinner at a nearby restaurant. Later
they walked to a neighborhood movie where
they enjoyed the feature program.</p>

<p>When they returned to the apartment, Mattie
Clark was there, still mad at the long delay
which had kept her away from Chicago.</p>

<p>&#8220;Imagine having to stay out at the emergency
field at Sterling almost all day,&#8221; she
stormed. She turned on Sue angrily.</p>

<p>&#8220;If you hadn&#8217;t been so pig-headed back in
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_160'></a>160</span>Cheyenne, I&#8217;d have been on the first section
and at least arrived during the daytime.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You can thank me you weren&#8217;t on the first
section,&#8221; replied Sue calmly. &#8220;We got lost
and were coming down for a crash landing
when the fog cleared at Joliet and we sneaked
down there. I was scared to death.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mattie looked at Sue skeptically.</p>

<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t seem to believe me,&#8221; said Sue.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, it&#8217;s a good story,&#8221; said Mattie.</p>

<p>Jane&#8217;s anger had mounted steadily and it got
away from her.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s enough, Mattie. We might as well
have it out right now. I think you&#8217;re mean
and small. You&#8217;re doing everything you can
to make it unpleasant for Miss Comstock, and
now you&#8217;re insulting Sue, because you know
Sue is too even-tempered to fight back. Now
just get out of here and after this keep out of
my way.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mattie was furious and her face flamed with
anger, but before she could reply, Alice
stepped in.</p>

<p>&#8220;What Jane said goes for Grace and me,&#8221;
she said. &#8220;The less we see of you, the better.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll all be sorry for this,&#8221; flared Mattie
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_161'></a>161</span>as she slammed the door and went into the
apartment across the hall.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sorry this had to happen,&#8221; Jane told
the others, &#8220;but Mattie is out for trouble and
she&#8217;s going to get it. From now on keep your
eyes open, for she&#8217;ll trick you if she can.&#8221;</p>

<p>The stewardesses soon settled into the routine
of the flights from Cheyenne to Chicago
and return. It was interesting, pleasant work.</p>

<p>Jane banked the money she had received
from the New York paper and from Mrs. Van
Verity Vanness and when Charlie Fischer
asked her if she&#8217;d like to take lessons in flying,
she had the money necessary.</p>

<p>Charlie had a biplane at Cheyenne and between
flights with the huge Federated planes,
amused himself by hopping around the countryside
and giving lessons to whatever pupils
he could pick up. Of the stewardesses, Jane
was the only girl who decided to take lessons.</p>

<p>Whenever she and Charlie were at Cheyenne,
he took her up for flights, explaining the
principles of aeronautics and letting her get
the feel of the plane. One afternoon they flew
to Denver and back, and on another occasion,
went to Laramie.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_162'></a>162</span>Jane was blessed with air sense. When she
had her hands on the control stick, she could
almost anticipate every movement of the plane
and Charlie praised her aptitude warmly.</p>

<p>The days rolled into mid-summer and July
in Cheyenne was hot. It was refreshing to seek
the coolness of the upper air in the late afternoon
and Jane spent as much extra time aloft
as she could afford. Then came the afternoon
for her solo flight. The government inspector
arrived and took his place in the rear cockpit.</p>

<p>Charlie Fischer looked up and grinned.</p>

<p>&#8220;Just forget the guy back there,&#8221; he said,
&#8220;and you&#8217;ll get along fine.&#8221;</p>

<p>Jane&#8217;s throat tightened. Going up with a
government inspector was quite different from
going up with Charlie,</p>

<p>She opened the throttle and the biplane shot
across the sun-baked field. Jane was glad the
other girls were out on the line, for it would be
embarrassing to come down and face them if
the inspector should turn her down.</p>

<p>She lifted the biplane into the air and got altitude
in easy circles over the airport. Then
she started through the routine. As the thrill
of the flight got into her blood, she forgot the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_163'></a>163</span>inspector in the rear cockpit and gave her every
energy to piloting the plane. With grace and
skill, she directed the maneuvers until the inspector
reached ahead, tapped her on the shoulder,
and nodded toward the ground.</p>

<p>Jane cut the motor and they drifted down.
Charlie Fischer was the first to reach the plane.</p>

<p>&#8220;How about it?&#8221; he asked the inspector.</p>

<p>&#8220;Just about perfect,&#8221; smiled the government
official.</p>

<p>&#8220;Then I&#8217;ll get my license?&#8221; Jane asked
breathlessly.</p>

<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s no question about that. I&#8217;m giving
you an exceptionally high rating. Your
license will be through shortly.&#8221;</p>

<p>It was another ten days, before the precious
card with her license arrived from Washington
and Jane showed it proudly to her roommates.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s nice,&#8221; admitted Sue, &#8220;but what on
earth will you do with it? You haven&#8217;t a plane
and you can&#8217;t afford to rent Charlie Fischer&#8217;s.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I honestly don&#8217;t know,&#8221; confessed Jane,
&#8220;but I wanted it. Some day I&#8217;ll be glad that I
have the license and the ability to fly a plane.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mattie Clark was still causing trouble. Any
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_164'></a>164</span>other girl who so rankly showed her insubordination
would have been fired within a
week, but the fact that Mattie&#8217;s uncle was a
company official saved her time and again.
She knew she was treading on thin ice, but she
seemed to take whole-hearted enjoyment in
making Miss Comstock and the other girls miserable.
Jane was her special hate.</p>

<p>Jane was still on the <i>Coast to Coast</i>, the crack
run of the line, and summer had slipped over
into August. A burning wind swept down
out of the mountains and it was hot that morning
when the eastbound <i>Coast to Coast</i> drifted
in.</p>

<p>Mattie had been assigned to a westbound
plane for the day, and was in the commissary
while Jane checked over her supplies. As
usual, Mattie made as many caustic remarks as
possible, but Jane refused to answer.</p>

<p>Jane finished preparing the supplies to place
aboard the plane and went out to call a field boy
to help her carry the large hamper. When she
returned with the boy, Mattie was still in the
commissary and Jane looked at her sharply.
Mattie flushed, but Jane thought nothing more
of the incident.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_165'></a>165</span>The <i>Coast to Coast</i> was loaded and Jane sat
on the jump seat at the rear of the plane. It
was the usual crowd&mdash;a second-rate movie actress,
several New York traveling men with
flashy clothes, an elderly lady called east by a
death in the family and the rest business men
and women who had taken the plane to save
time on their trip east.</p>

<p>Jane made sure that everyone had traveling
kits, answered several questions about the
weather ahead, and checked over her passenger
list to see that everyone was in the proper seat.</p>

<p>The ship rolled out of the hangar and swept
away into the east. Jane picked up the magazines
and went along the aisle, offering them to
passengers who cared to read. Most of them
preferred to gaze at the landscape below.</p>

<p>They were east of Grand Island when Jane
prepared lunch, serving sandwiches, a cool
salad and an iced drink she had brought in a
large thermos jug.</p>

<p>It was early afternoon when they cleared
Omaha, with a stop scheduled ahead at Des
Moines, the last one until Chicago. Council
Bluffs had barely dropped out of sight when
Jane began to feel ill. Just then a woman
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_166'></a>166</span>called her. She was feeling uneasy and Jane
gave her a soda tablet.</p>

<p>She had hardly returned to her seat when
everyone appeared stricken at the same moment.
Her passengers became deathly ill and
Jane herself was so sick she could hardly move.
She managed to stagger ahead to the pilots&#8217;
cockpit and told them of what had happened.
The big ship was turned about at once, roaring
back for Omaha, while the co-pilot sent out a
rush call for ambulances and doctors to meet it
at the field.</p>

<p>By the time the tri-motor reached the
Omaha field, Jane was too ill to move and
everyone in the cabin was carried out and taken
to the hospital for treatment.</p>

<p>Just before she left the field, Jane spoke to
the chief pilot.</p>

<p>&#8220;Save the lunch,&#8221; she whispered. &#8220;It must
have been that.&#8221;</p>

<p>He nodded and hurried away to see what he
could find in the pantry.</p>

<p>Somehow the Omaha papers got hold of the
story, and printed it on their front pages. As
a result Hubert Speidel, the personnel chief,
hurried out from Chicago on the first plane to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_167'></a>167</span>make an investigation, and it was at Jane&#8217;s request
that he had the food analyzed. Shortly
after that he ordered an investigation to be held
at Cheyenne and Jane, still weak from her sudden
illness, wondered what he had learned.</p>

<p class='line mb2ch center'><i>Sue Plays Detective</i></p>
</div>

<p><span class='sc'>Jane</span>, who had been the most seriously ill of
those aboard the <i>Coast to Coast Limited</i>, was
in the Omaha hospital three days. She was far
from well when she boarded a westbound
plane for the inquiry at Cheyenne. The incident
had brought unfavorable publicity to
the line, and the personnel director was determined
to get at the bottom of it.</p>

<p>The investigation was held in the administration
building of the Cheyenne airport. In
addition to Mr. Speidel, Miss Comstock was
there, the pilots who had been on the plane,
and Sue.</p>

<p>Jane was questioned first.</p>

<p>&#8220;Did you prepare the food which was placed
aboard the plane that day?&#8221; the personnel chief
asked her.</p>

<p>&#8220;Not all of it,&#8221; she replied. &#8220;The salad was
supplied by the caterer, but I made the sandwiches
and prepared the iced tea.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_169'></a>169</span>&#8220;Did anyone else touch the food?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not that I know of.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Was anyone else in the commissary while
you were working?&#8221; continued the personnel
director.</p>

<p>Jane was about to reply that she was alone
when she remembered that Mattie had been
there.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mattie Clark was there,&#8221; she said, wondering
just what Mr. Speidel was attempting to
learn from her.</p>

<p>&#8220;You know what caused the illness aboard
the plane?&#8221; he went on.</p>

<p>&#8220;It was a strong irritant of some kind,&#8221; she
replied, &#8220;but I wasn&#8217;t told at the hospital just
what it was.&#8221;</p>

<p>The personnel director switched to another
track.</p>

<p>&#8220;You wouldn&#8217;t have had any reason to place
anything in the food, would you?&#8221;</p>

<p>Jane&#8217;s face flushed, and it was a struggle to
keep from showing her intense anger, but she
finally managed to reply &#8220;no,&#8221; in a calm voice.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you know anyone who would do it as
a grudge against you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That question is hardly fair,&#8221; retorted
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_170'></a>170</span>Jane. &#8220;If I mention any names I might unjustly
throw suspicion on someone who is not
guilty.&#8221;</p>

<p>Through her mind, though, raced thoughts
of Mattie and her promise of revenge. Mattie
had been alone in the commissary long
enough to dope the sandwiches or the salad,
and she was capable of stooping to such a low
trick. No matter what happened, as a result of
the investigation, Jane resolved to see Mattie
and have a talk with her.</p>

<p>&#8220;What do you know about this, Miss Comstock?&#8221;
asked the personnel director, turning
to the chief of the stewardess service.</p>

<p>&#8220;Very little, but I am sure that Miss Cameron
is being treated very unfairly if anyone
thinks she deliberately planned such a distressing
incident as the one which took place
aboard the <i>Coast to Coast</i> the other day.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But isn&#8217;t it true that Miss Cameron is one
of your favorites?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am no more partial to her than to the
other girls. It happens that she is a most efficient
and personable stewardess. I only wish
that all of the girls were as capable as she.&#8221;</p>

<p>The pilots also spoke a good word for Jane,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_171'></a>171</span>but she knew she was in a tight spot. Someone
had prejudiced the personnel director against
her and she strongly suspected the fine hand of
Mattie Clark, working through her uncle.</p>

<p>Then Sue took a hand in the proceedings.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve been doing a little investigating on my
own account,&#8221; she said. &#8220;It may interest you
to know that a member of the stewardess staff
bought the drug which was used to cause the
illness aboard the plane.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What do you know about this?&#8221; demanded
Mr. Speidel.</p>

<p>&#8220;Enough to clear Jane of any part in it,&#8221; replied
Sue. &#8220;I have a sworn statement from the
druggist who made the sale. He knows the
stewardess who made the purchase and named
her in the affidavit.&#8221;</p>

<p>Sue waved the paper and the personnel chief
seized it eagerly.</p>

<p>&#8220;I think this investigation is over,&#8221; he said as
he finished reading the affidavit. &#8220;I am sorry,
Miss Cameron, to have caused you any embarrassment.&#8221;</p>

<p>Once outside, Jane hugged Sue enthusiastically.</p>

<p>&#8220;You were a peach to do that piece of sleuthing,&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_172'></a>172</span>she said. &#8220;For a while it looked like I
was in a tight place.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But you haven&#8217;t asked me who bought the
drug,&#8221; said Sue.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t need to. It was Mattie. I remembered
seeing her in the commissary the other
day. Honestly, I hardly thought Mattie
would stoop to such a trick. Why, think what
would have happened if the pilots had eaten
any of that lunch.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I did,&#8221; replied Sue, &#8220;which is one reason
why I went sneaking around the drug stores in
Cheyenne. Mattie was pretty sure of herself
for she bought it in the store where we usually
go for our sodas. The druggist didn&#8217;t want
to give me an affidavit, but when I threatened
to swing all of the stewardess trade to the store
across the street he decided to sign.&#8221;</p>

<p>They were having dinner that night at Mrs.
Murphy&#8217;s when Alice, just off a run from the
east, came in.</p>

<p>&#8220;Guess who I saw leaving the field?&#8221; she
said.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mattie Clark,&#8221; replied Jane.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re a mind-reader. It was Mattie and
she was going as a passenger. What&#8217;s up?&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_173'></a>173</span>Sue told Alice briefly what had taken place
during the afternoon.</p>

<p>&#8220;Serves Mattie right,&#8221; said Alice. &#8220;Everything
will be smoother now that she&#8217;s gone.
But I&#8217;ve got some news none of you will guess.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t keep us waiting too long,&#8221; smiled
Jane.</p>

<p>&#8220;Roscoe James, the famous film director,
came out on the plane from Chicago.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s nothing. Frederic March flew east
with me the other day and never even looked
at me,&#8221; said Sue.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, but Roscoe James stopped here.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Which means what?&#8221; asked Jane.</p>

<p>&#8220;His company, the Mammoth, is going to
film an air story with the Cheyenne field for
the background.&#8221;</p>

<div>
<a id='ch19'></a>
<p class='line mt3ch center'><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_174'></a>174</span><span class='sc'>Chapter Nineteen</span></p>
<p class='line mb2ch center'><i>Needed&mdash;One Pilot</i></p>
</div>

<p><span class='sc'>Jane</span> and Sue looked at Alice incredulously.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you mean to stand there and tell me that
Roscoe James and the Mammoth Film Company
are going to make a motion picture here
at the Cheyenne field?&#8221; demanded Sue.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not going to stand and tell you,&#8221; sighed
Alice, dropping into a chair. &#8220;I&#8217;m going to
ease my weary legs, but at the same time, I&#8217;ll repeat
that the local field is going to be used for
the background of the next Roscoe James feature
production.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Maybe we&#8217;ll get a chance to work as
extras,&#8221; gasped Sue.</p>

<p>&#8220;About all we can hope to do is to be on the
sidelines looking on,&#8221; said Alice. &#8220;Mr. James
was talking to the operations manager when I
left the field. The company will be here next
week to start work on the outdoor scenes, all
of which will be filmed here.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What luck for me,&#8221; put in Jane. &#8220;I&#8217;ve
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_175'></a>175</span>only one round trip to Chicago scheduled.
That means I&#8217;ll have most of the week here,
where I can watch the company at work.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And if they need a cook, maybe it will be
my chance to get in the movies,&#8221; added Mrs.
Murphy as she hurried in from the kitchen.
Little of the girls&#8217; conversation escaped Mrs.
Murphy and she had kept an ear finely tuned
to their talk about the coming of the film company.</p>

<p>Jane was scheduled east the next morning on
the <i>Coast to Coast</i>. Just before the ship came
in from Salt Lake City, she saw the famous film
director in conference with the operations
manager. With them was Charlie Fischer.
After a time he ambled over to talk with Jane.</p>

<p>&#8220;Going to be great doings here,&#8221; grinned
Charlie. &#8220;I&#8217;m in the movies already.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What are you going to do?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;They&#8217;ve got to have some stunt flying and
they can&#8217;t afford to have the leading man risk
his neck. I&#8217;m elected to pilot the ship. Means
a lot of fun and quite a few extra shekels.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Try and get me a job as an extra,&#8221; urged
Jane.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll do my best, but the star might object.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_176'></a>176</span>When Jane returned from Chicago a part
of the technical crew had arrived and equipment
was being set up at the field. Every girl
in the stewardess corps was hopeful that she
might be selected for some extra role for all of
them secretly cherished the desire to be a film
star.</p>

<p>Grace, coming in from the west on a late
plane, rushed in and woke them.</p>

<p>&#8220;Who do you suppose came in with me?&#8221;
she gasped.</p>

<p>&#8220;Probably Gary Macklin,&#8221; said Sue, naming
the latest Hollywood favorite.</p>

<p>&#8220;Good guess,&#8221; said Grace.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you mean Gary Macklin is going to
have the leading role in the picture here?&#8221; demanded
Alice, now thoroughly awake.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s just what I mean, and his leading
lady is going to be Claudette Barrett. She
came in on the same plane.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;My favorite combination,&#8221; breathed Sue.
 &#8220;I think I&#8217;ll ask for a leave of absence.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not much chance of your getting that, for
business on the line is picking up every day,&#8221;
said Jane.</p>

<p>&#8220;You should comment, with only one trip
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_177'></a>177</span>scheduled next week. How about trading
schedules?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I should say not. I&#8217;m just as anxious as you
are to see how a film is made,&#8221; smiled Jane.</p>

<p>&#8220;Does anyone know what the story is
about?&#8221; Alice asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;I heard Mr. Macklin and Miss Barrett talking
about it when we stopped at Rock Springs.
Miss Barrett is going to have the role of a stewardess
and Mr. Macklin plays the part of the ace
pilot of the line.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Charlie Fischer should have that role,&#8221; put
in Sue.</p>

<p>&#8220;Charlie&#8217;s going to do the stunt flying,&#8221; said
Jane.</p>

<p>&#8220;If Miss Barrett&#8217;s going to be a stewardess,
we ought to see quite a bit of her,&#8221; Alice said
hopefully. &#8220;If there&#8217;s anything dangerous to
be done, we might even get a chance to double
for her.&#8221;</p>

<p>More members of the cast of &#8220;The Sky
Riders,&#8221; as the film was tentatively titled, arrived
over the week-end and on Monday
morning the company was ready to start shooting
the scenes.</p>

<p>The Cheyenne airport had been given a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_178'></a>178</span>thorough cleaning and everything from fences
and lights around the border to the wind sock
on the beacon tower had been touched up.</p>

<p>Jane, due out on the <i>Coast to Coast</i>, watched
the company assembling. Roscoe James, the
director, was a giant of a man, well over six feet
in height and broad of shoulder.</p>

<p>A taxi rolled up and Claudette Barrett, the
leading woman, stepped out. She was a trifle
taller than Jane, with brown hair and brown
eyes, and Jane was surprised to see the film
star wearing the uniform of a Federated Airways
stewardess. It was perfectly tailored and
Miss Barrett even had the jaunty little beret
fitted snugly over her carefully marcelled hair.
She had a pleasant smile and spoke to several
members of the company.</p>

<p>Another cab arrived and Gary Macklin, tall,
dark and strikingly handsome, jumped out.
He gave Jane the impression of always being in
a hurry and of having an abundance of energy.</p>

<p>A camera crew had its equipment ready and
when the <i>Coast to Coast</i> came into view,
started grinding away. The big plane landed
smoothly and rolled into the hangar.</p>

<p>Jane forced herself to turn to her duties and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_179'></a>179</span>she went forward to relieve the stewardess who
had come in from Salt Lake City, taking over
the passenger list and making sure that her own
supplies were placed aboard the plane. She
was stowing the lunch away in the pantry
when someone spoke to her and she turned to
face Claudette Barrett.</p>

<p>&#8220;I hope I won&#8217;t bother you,&#8221; said the film
star, &#8220;but since I&#8217;m supposed to be a stewardess,
I&#8217;ve got to learn something about the business.&#8221;
She had a pleasant smile and Jane felt an instant
liking for this attractive girl of the films.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll be glad to show you whatever I can.
I&#8217;m Jane Cameron.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, I&#8217;ve read lots about you. You were
the stewardess who was with Mrs. Van Verity
Vanness when bandits tried to abduct her. I
was in New York at the time and read all about
it in the <i>Globe</i>. What a thrilling experience
that must have been.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I wouldn&#8217;t want very many of them,&#8221; confessed
Jane.</p>

<p>&#8220;Go ahead with your work. I&#8217;ll just watch
and ask questions.&#8221; Jane stowed the contents
of the large hamper away in the pantry and
looked at her watch.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_180'></a>180</span>&#8220;We&#8217;ve only three more minutes here.
It&#8217;s time now to get the passengers back into
the plane.&#8221;</p>

<p>Jane led the way outside. Over in front of
the commissary Sue, Alice and Grace were
watching the proceedings enviously.</p>

<p>&#8220;My roommates are all anxious to meet
you,&#8221; Jane said, &#8220;and they&#8217;ll be glad to give
you any assistance possible.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m going to need it,&#8221; smiled the film star.</p>

<p>The girls were almost overwhelmed when
Jane brought Miss Barrett to meet them, but
they found her so natural and interested in
their work that they were soon conversing with
her freely.</p>

<p>The last Jane saw of them as the <i>Coast to
Coast</i> roared away, they were taking Miss Barrett
into the stewardess headquarters.</p>

<p>When Jane returned on Wednesday, the
film company was in the midst of active shooting.
Two of the big tri-motored transports
had been chartered for use and were landing
and taking off for special shots of the field
while camera crews on the ground photographed
them.</p>

<p>At dinner that night, the girls told Jane how
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_181'></a>181</span>they had been drafted as extras for a crowd
scene in the hangar.</p>

<p>&#8220;It was thrilling,&#8221; said Alice. &#8220;Just think,
actually in the movies.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We even got paid just for standing around.
I&#8217;d almost have been willing to pay them,&#8221; put
in Grace.</p>

<p>&#8220;The worst of it is,&#8221; mourned Sue, &#8220;more
crowd scenes are scheduled for shooting tomorrow
and we&#8217;re all scheduled out.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;All except lucky Jane, who&#8217;s in for the
rest of the week,&#8221; said Grace.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll try and skip around in the crowd scenes
and take the places of all of you,&#8221; Jane consoled
them.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mrs. Murphy&#8217;s going to be the Cheyenne
star in the picture,&#8221; chuckled Sue. &#8220;The director
saw her at the field and he drafted her
for a comedy role. It was taken this morning
and was as funny as could be. They dressed
Mrs. Murphy up in an old-fashioned outfit
with a bonnet and a parrot in a cage. She was
taking her first trip by plane and all she had to
do was to look flustered and talk about her
fear.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, and Mrs. Murphy&#8217;s never been up,&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_182'></a>182</span>added Grace. &#8220;When she started toward the
plane she forgot all about being in a movie and
began to get scared. By the time she reached
the steps, she wasn&#8217;t acting and Miss Barrett
and Mr. Macklin had to almost force her into
the ship. Mrs. Murphy&#8217;s brogue was so thick
you could cut it and the whole film crew
laughed until they were just about worn out.
Mrs. Murphy got a hundred dollars for the
scene and she&#8217;s tickled to death.&#8221;</p>

<p>All the girls were scheduled out on early
ships the next morning and Jane went to the
field with them. Even at that hour, Director
James was on hand making plans for the day&#8217;s
schedule.</p>

<p>After the early planes had cleared the field,
Jane saw him talking to Charlie Fischer, who
had been given a leave of absence to do the
stunt flying. A few minutes later Charlie
came over and joined her.</p>

<p>&#8220;This is my big day,&#8221; he said. &#8220;If I do all
of the tricks they want me to, I&#8217;ll go crazy.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What do you have to do?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;They&#8217;re practically re-enacting the scene
of the bandit plane attacking us, and I&#8217;ve got
to fly the bandit ship. They had a chap from
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_183'></a>183</span>Denver slated to come up and do that while
I flew the army plane which arrived just in
time. Now I&#8217;ll have to fly the bandit plane
through a lot of maneuvers and then come
down, get another ship which will be painted
like an army plane, and do some more stunts all
around one of the tri-motors.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But that won&#8217;t seem like an aerial battle.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The director says they can cut the film
in the laboratory so it will look all right. Of
course he&#8217;d like to have both the bandit and
the army ships up at the same time, but he&#8217;s
short a pilot and the scene must be filmed this
morning. Hiring these big tri-motors is cutting
heavily into his expense budget.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why not let me fly one of the ships?&#8221;
suggested Jane. &#8220;If you were in the other one,
I know I&#8217;d get along all right.&#8221;</p>

<p>Charlie looked at her sharply.</p>

<p>&#8220;Golly, Jane, I never thought of that. Say,
my ship is the one that&#8217;s been painted up as the
bandit plane. You could fly that with your
eyes shut and I could take the army plane.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I know we could do it,&#8221; said Jane.</p>

<p>&#8220;Then here goes. We&#8217;re on our way to see
the director right now.&#8221;</p>

</div>

<p><span class='sc'>Director James</span> was giving orders to the
camera crew which was to go aloft in one of
the tri-motors. He appeared tired and worried
and his greeting to Charlie Fischer was short.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not looking for any more extras,&#8221; he
growled as he saw Jane with the flyer.</p>

<p>&#8220;Sure, sure,&#8221; agreed Charlie, who had a
soothing and persuasive way, &#8220;but you do need
an extra pilot and you need one in a hurry.
This girl can handle one of the planes. I know,
I trained her to fly.&#8221;</p>

<p>The director stared at Charlie.</p>

<p>&#8220;Tell me another one,&#8221; he snorted.</p>

<p>&#8220;Listen,&#8221; said Charlie, &#8220;I&#8217;m not kidding.
This is straight from the shoulder. You let
this girl go up in my plane and she&#8217;ll do all of
the tricks your cameras can catch and a few
more thrown in. She&#8217;s a natural flyer, knows
the feel of a plane, becomes a part of it from
the second she gets into the cockpit.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_185'></a>185</span>Director James looked thoughtful. &#8220;We
do need another pilot,&#8221; he admitted, &#8220;but I
hate to think of a girl trying all of those stunts.&#8221;</p>

<p>Jane decided it was time to say a word.</p>

<p>&#8220;If I fly Charlie&#8217;s plane, I know I can handle
the assignment,&#8221; she said eagerly. &#8220;With
Charlie in the other ship there&#8217;ll be little chance
of anything going wrong. I&#8217;d like to have the
opportunity to try it.&#8221;</p>

<p>The director looked at his watch.</p>

<p>&#8220;We start shooting in half an hour,&#8221; he decided.
&#8220;We&#8217;ll take a chance.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Come on, Jane. We&#8217;ve got to work fast,&#8221;
said Charlie, seizing her arm and almost pulling
her after him. &#8220;Get into boots and breeches.
You&#8217;re going to wear a chute. If anything
should happen you&#8217;ll be ready for it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But, Charlie, I&#8217;ve never used a chute,&#8221; protested
Jane.</p>

<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s always a first time,&#8221; said Charlie
darkly. &#8220;Now mind what I tell you.&#8221;</p>

<p>Jane hurried into the stewardess quarters
where she kept her flying clothes in a locker.
Miss Comstock came in while she was changing.</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s this I hear about you piloting one of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_186'></a>186</span>the planes for the movie people?&#8221; she asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m going to be a bold, bad bandit,&#8221; smiled
Jane. &#8220;They&#8217;re short a flyer and can&#8217;t wait
for another man to come up from Denver.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But don&#8217;t you think it&#8217;s rather dangerous?
I don&#8217;t want to lose my star stewardess.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nothing will happen,&#8221; promised Jane.
&#8220;I&#8217;ll be flying Charlie&#8217;s ship and I could do that
blindfolded.&#8221;</p>

<p>She pulled her boots on and tied a scarlet
scarf around her bobbed hair. In brown boots,
white breeches, a soft white silk shirt open at
the neck and the flaming scarf around her hair,
Jane was a striking picture.</p>

<p>&#8220;Look out,&#8221; cautioned Miss Comstock, &#8220;or
the film people will be offering you a contract.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No chance. You&#8217;ve got to be able to act.&#8221;
Jane dabbed a bit of fresh powder on her cheeks
and hurried out to greet Charlie Fischer. The
tall pilot was wearing one chute pack and he
carried another in his arms.</p>

<p>&#8220;Just about time to start,&#8221; he said. &#8220;The
ships are over on the ramp warming up.&#8221;</p>

<p>Jane looked at Charlie&#8217;s plane. The speedy
old biplane had been repainted and now was
shining black. Just beyond it was a smaller and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_187'></a>187</span>faster biplane painted to represent an army pursuit
craft. It was this ship that Charlie was to
handle.</p>

<p>Director James was waiting between the
planes. He eyed Jane approvingly as she approached
for she looked cool and business-like.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re to fly as though attacking the No. 1
transport,&#8221; he told Jane. &#8220;Keep away from
the second ship with the camera crew. Make
it look good. We&#8217;ve got a machine gun
mounted on your plane and when you dash in,
pull the trigger and send bursts of blanks at the
transport.&#8221;</p>

<p>While he was giving his instructions, the
first transport roared into the air. As soon as
the drone of the motors faded, he continued.</p>

<p>&#8220;On signal from the camera plane, Charlie
will drop down on you. I want you two to
make it look like a good aerial dog-fight.
Twist and turn and do plenty of power diving.
When you see a red flag waved from the
camera plane, go into a dive and jerk the smoke
pot lever that&#8217;s been rigged into your plane.
That will release a cloud of smoke and make
it appear that you&#8217;re going down in flames.
All of this must be done above 3,000 feet. At
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_188'></a>188</span>1,000 feet you level off for we won&#8217;t try to
follow you with the cameras below that point.
Think you understand everything?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sure I do,&#8221; replied Jane.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you worry,&#8221; put in Charlie. &#8220;This
is going to be the best air action your cameras
ever caught.&#8221;</p>

<p>Jane adjusted the straps of her parachute and
Charlie boosted her into the cockpit of his biplane.</p>

<p>&#8220;If anything goes wrong,&#8221; he told her, &#8220;just
bale over the side and after you&#8217;re clear, jerk
the ring. Don&#8217;t worry about the ship. I made
the movie people sign a guarantee to replace it,
if anything should happen.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nothing&#8217;s going to happen,&#8221; said Jane
firmly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Atta girl. Let&#8217;s go.&#8221;</p>

<p>Charlie ran to the other plane and hoisted
his long legs into the cockpit. Jane opened the
motor of the biplane, waved to Miss Comstock,
who was standing nearby, and then sped across
the field.</p>

<p>It was a glorious summer morning and to the
north and west the peaks of the majestic
Rockies reared their heads above the clouds
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_189'></a>189</span>which obscured their lower levels. Jane
tingled with the zest of her adventure. She was
actually in the movies. Of course she was just
doing a stunt, but when &#8220;The Sky Riders&#8221;
came to Cheyenne she would have the pleasure
of knowing that she had piloted one of the
planes in an important piece of action.</p>

<p>Above Jane the first tri-motor, the plane
she was to attack, was climbing steadily while
the second of the big ships, with the director
and main camera crew, was wheeling off the
field. Charlie was already in the air, following
her fast.</p>

<p>It took them fifteen minutes to get into position
for action and at a signal from the director
in the second tri-motor, the first plane lined
away west, simulating a transport in regular
flight. Jane, who was a thousand feet above
the transport, jammed the throttle on full and
dove for the big plane.</p>

<p>The wings of her biplane trembled under the
crashing dive, but she knew the plane&#8217;s capabilities
and her heart thrilled as she roared down
on the big ship.</p>

<p>The machine gun spouted flame and smoke
as she pulled the trigger. She flashed past the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_190'></a>190</span>tri-motor, nosed up, and poured another volley
of fake bullets at the big ship. Now the chase
was on in earnest, the pilots of the tri-motor
making every attempt to elude the pursuer
and Jane was astounded at the tricky flying
which could be done with one of the big transports.</p>

<p>Back and forth they roared through the sky,
twisting and turning, until it became a real
game. Then the roar of another motor came
to Jane&#8217;s ears and she looked back to see Charlie
dropping down on her. That was her cue to
stop chasing the tri-motor and attempt to save
herself.</p>

<p>She dropped her own plane into a quick,
twisting dive, that caught Charlie unawares and
he missed her the first time, but he came fighting
back, his own machine gun spouting blanks.
For twenty minutes they twisted and turned,
first Charlie gaining the advantage and then
Jane. Then she saw a red flag waving from
the camera plane. It was the signal for the dive
on which she was to release the smoke pot.</p>

<p>Charlie was well above her, diving again.
Jane waited until his plane was almost on her.
Then she spun her own ship into a twisting
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_191'></a>191</span>plunge and tripped the trigger of the smoke pot
apparatus.</p>

<p>Almost instantly a cloud of thick, heavy
smoke rolled out of the fuselage behind her
and Charlie&#8217;s plane disappeared for a second
in the smoke screen.</p>

<p>Jane watched the altimeter. She had been
up 3,100 feet when she released the smoke pot.
At a thousand feet above ground she was to
level off and scoot back to the Cheyenne field.</p>

<p>She had been too busy warding off Charlie&#8217;s
attack to watch just where they were and was
surprised to find herself just north of the home
field. For all Jane knew they might have been
thirty miles away.</p>

<p>The biplane spun down dizzily, the speed
increasing until the wing wires screamed in
protest. But it was good action and Jane
knew the movie cameras would catch every bit
of it as the smoking plane thundered toward
the ground.</p>

<p>She felt remarkably cool as the speed increased.
She had every confidence in the
sturdy old biplane and at 1,800 feet she pulled
the stick back a bit to see how the plane responded.
To her horror there was no lessening
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_192'></a>192</span>in the angle of the dive and she turned
quickly. The controls had jammed and the
tail of her plane was ablaze, set afire in some
way by the smoke pot.</p>

<div>
<a id='ch21'></a>
<p class='line mt3ch center'><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_193'></a>193</span><span class='sc'>Chapter Twenty-one</span></p>
<p class='line mb2ch center'><i>Too Much Action</i></p>
</div>

<p><span class='sc'>For</span> a moment sickening panic gripped Jane.
Then she remembered that Charlie had insisted
that she wear a parachute and there was
plenty of time for her to bail out of the falling
plane.</p>

<p>Jane looked back. Charlie&#8217;s ship sped out of
the trail of smoke and she saw his tense face
peering over the cockpit. Behind him boomed
the camera ship, recording every movement of
the planes.</p>

<p>The flames, whipped by the wind, mounted
and Jane knew there was little time to lose.
They were down to 1,200 feet and she steeled
herself for the leap from the plane.</p>

<p>It was her first jump and she hesitated for a
moment. Desperately she tried the controls
again but there was no hope there. The plane
was falling at an alarming rate of speed.</p>

<p>Jane crouched in the seat, making sure that
the chute was clear of any obstructions. It
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_194'></a>194</span>took nerve and a cool head to do what was
ahead. At 1,000 feet she shot out of the plane,
doubling over twice as she tumbled through
the air.</p>

<p>The blazing biplane roared past her and she
pulled the chute ring, using both hands. Behind
her the pilot chute cracked out and then
the great silken umbrella filled with air. Her
plunge downward was stopped suddenly and
she found herself drifting 800 feet above the
ground.</p>

<p>The leap from the plane had been so sudden
Jane had no time to analyze her feelings while
she fell, but now, swinging below the parachute,
she felt weak and sick.</p>

<p>The biplane spun downward, smoke and
flame shooting from the fuselage. Close behind
it followed Charlie, riding it to the
ground, while above hovered the camera ship.</p>

<p>Jane was swinging under the chute in a wide
arc. That would never do for she would be
slapped hard against the ground. Pulling on
the lines above, she checked the swinging.
There was a slight wind from the north that
would take her down on the Cheyenne airport.</p>

<p>Jane watched the biplane closely as it neared
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_195'></a>195</span>the ground. It struck, nose first and then disappeared
in a volcano of smoke and flame.</p>

<p>Jane closed her eyes and when she opened
them she had drifted past the scene of the
wrecked plane and was coming down over the
north boundary of the airport. A car from
the main building was racing toward her. Jane
recognized the ambulance trailing after it.
They were taking no chances.</p>

<p>She tried to relax as the chute neared the
ground. She knew that tense muscles might
result in a broken bone for landing in a parachute
was anything but a lark.</p>

<p>Three field mechanics jumped from the car
and ran to catch Jane as she landed. One of
them managed to reach her in time to ease the
shock of the fall, but she got a severe jar.</p>

<p>They helped Jane out of the chute harness
and she stepped clear just as Miss Comstock arrived
aboard the ambulance.</p>

<p>&#8220;Are you hurt, Jane?&#8221; she asked anxiously.</p>

<p>&#8220;Just scared a little,&#8221; confessed Jane, who
now felt trembly all over.</p>

<p>&#8220;I was so afraid you weren&#8217;t going to jump
in time,&#8221; said the chief stewardess. &#8220;I&#8217;m about
ready to go to the hospital myself.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_196'></a>196</span>Just then Charlie Fischer pan-caked in for
a quick landing, leaped from his plane and ran
toward them.</p>

<p>&#8220;All right, Jane?&#8221; he asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, but your plane&#8217;s a wreck,&#8221; she replied,
pointing beyond the north boundary of the
field where flames were licking around the remains
of the biplane.</p>

<p>&#8220;Forget about the plane,&#8221; growled Charlie,
&#8220;just as long as you came out all right.&#8221;</p>

<p>Jane entered the field car and Miss Comstock
accompanied her, the mechanics remaining to
fold up the parachute. While on their way
back to the administration building, the camera
plane landed. As soon as it reached the hangar,
the director leaped out and hurried toward
Jane.</p>

<p>Before he could reach her, Charlie, who had
taxied his plane across the field, cut in. He was
raging mad at the slip-shod work of the movie
men who had made the installation of the
smoke pot in the ship Jane had flown.</p>

<p>&#8220;You ought to be kicked clear off the field,&#8221;
he shouted at the director. &#8220;There wasn&#8217;t any
danger in the stunt until we had to depend on
the work of some of your men and then everything
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_197'></a>197</span>went wrong. I&#8217;ve a good notion to sock
somebody.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It was a regrettable accident,&#8221; admitted the
director, attempting to placate the angry
Charlie, &#8220;and the company is willing to pay
Miss Cameron handsomely for her work.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Fat lot of good that would have done her if
she hadn&#8217;t got down all right,&#8221; snorted Charlie.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m very sorry the smoke pot set the plane
on fire,&#8221; said the director turning to Jane.
&#8220;As you know I was hesitant about having you
fly at all.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t blame you for the accident,&#8221; replied
Jane. &#8220;We did so much twisting and
turning up there that the smoke pot was probably
dislodged. I hope it didn&#8217;t spoil your
film.&#8221;</p>

<p>The director smiled. &#8220;I think we&#8217;ve probably
the best airplane shots ever made for the
cameramen were able to follow your ship until
it crashed. Of course we&#8217;ll have to cut a few
feet where you jumped, but that can be done
very easily.&#8221;</p>

<p>Jane&#8217;s work was over and she wanted to get
away and be alone for a time. Perhaps she&#8217;d
even cry a little for the tension had been terrific.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_198'></a>198</span>She slipped away and went to Mrs.
Murphy&#8217;s where she undressed, took a refreshing
bath, and went to bed. It was early evening
when she wakened and went down stairs.</p>

<p>Mrs. Murphy emerged from the kitchen.</p>

<p>&#8220;A gentleman called a time ago and left this
letter for you. I think he was from the film
company.&#8221;</p>

<p>Jane looked at the letter. The return address
was that of the leading hotel in the city.
She opened the envelope and drew out a crisp
check. It was made payable to Jane Cameron
in the amount of $250 and was signed by Roscoe
James for the Mammoth Film Company.</p>

<p>Jane&#8217;s eyes blurred. Why that check would
more than equal all of the money she had spent
learning how to fly, but she decided that she
wouldn&#8217;t want to do film stunts for a living.</p>

<p>There was a note with the check and Jane
read it eagerly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Dear Miss Cameron: We are showing
early shots of the film tonight at the hotel at
eight. The scenes taken this morning will be
included and we would like to have you present.
The check is in appreciation of your fine
work. Cordially, Roscoe James.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_199'></a>199</span>Jane&#8217;s heart leaped. She wouldn&#8217;t have to
wait until the picture was completed and released.
She could see the pictures of the airplane
action that night.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mrs. Murphy,&#8221; she called, &#8220;we&#8217;re going
to the hotel at eight o&#8217;clock. They&#8217;re showing
scenes of the picture which have been taken at
Cheyenne.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What a pity the other girls aren&#8217;t here,&#8221;
said Mrs. Murphy. &#8220;I&#8217;m all in a bustle I&#8217;m
that excited. Do you suppose I took well?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sure you did.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But did they invite me to see the pictures?&#8221;
asked Mrs. Murphy anxiously.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, they didn&#8217;t exactly mention you by
name, but I know they won&#8217;t object. You get
your hat and we&#8217;ll go along. We&#8217;ve only a
little more than time enough to get there now.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But you&#8217;ve had no supper, Jane.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not hungry. I&#8217;m too excited.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, you&#8217;re going to eat,&#8221; said Mrs. Murphy
firmly, who believed that food was necessary
at regular intervals. &#8220;There&#8217;s several
sandwiches and a glass of milk in the ice box.
You eat that while I&#8217;m fixing my hair.&#8221;</p>

<p>When they reached the hotel, Charlie
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_200'></a>200</span>Fischer and Miss Comstock were waiting in the
lobby.</p>

<p>&#8220;This is going to be a real treat,&#8221; smiled
Miss Comstock. &#8220;I never thought I&#8217;d be in a
movie, even as an extra in a crowd scene.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And I never dreamed that I would pilot a
plane with cameras recording the scene,&#8221; admitted
Jane.</p>

<p>&#8220;You might add that you never dreamed
you would have to take to a chute to get
down,&#8221; put in Charlie.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re right and once is enough,&#8221; said
Jane firmly.</p>

<p>The pictures were to be shown in the ballroom.
While they waited, Miss Barrett and
Gary Macklin came out of the dining room.
They paused to visit, awaiting the arrival of
the director.</p>

<p>&#8220;I hear I missed some unusual action by staying
in bed this morning,&#8221; smiled Miss Barrett.</p>

<p>&#8220;It was too much action,&#8221; said Charlie.</p>

<p>&#8220;How did you ever have the nerve to
jump?&#8221; the film star asked Jane.</p>

<p>&#8220;It wasn&#8217;t nerve,&#8221; replied Jane, &#8220;it was just
a case of necessity.&#8221;</p>

<p>The director arrived and they went into the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_201'></a>201</span>ballroom where a screen had been erected at
one end and a portable projector placed at the
other.</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re going to run through everything
we&#8217;ve taken,&#8221; explained the director as the
company, including cameramen and technicians,
gathered. Turning to the Federated
Airways people, he explained, &#8220;Of course there
is no sound on the print we&#8217;re running tonight.
The noise of the airplane engines will be produced
in the home studio and worked into the
sound track later.&#8221;</p>

<p>They found seats and the lights were turned
off. There was no title to precede the start of
the actual picture, the first scene being of the
Cheyenne airport with the <i>Coast to Coast
Limited</i> coming in from the west. Jane started
as she recognized the familiar action which had
taken place only that Monday morning. She
saw herself walking across the concrete floor
to speak to the incoming stewardess. Then she
entered the cabin and a few seconds later another
stewardess walked across the hangar.</p>

<p>Jane smiled for the second girl was Claudette
Barrett, looking exceedingly attractive in the
uniform of a Federated Airways stewardess.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_202'></a>202</span>Then there was a shot of the plane taking off,
and, after that, pictures of Miss Barrett and
Gary Macklin talking in the shadows of one of
the great tri-motors, several shots showing the
leading man at the controls of one of the big
planes, and a number showing him in the cockpit
of the army plane which Charlie had flown
that morning.</p>

<p>Pictures of the planes coming in at night,
especially, thrilled Jane. In the crowd scenes
she saw Sue, Alice, Grace and Miss Comstock.
Then came the unforgettable scene, with Mrs.
Murphy trying to make up her mind about
getting aboard the plane, and the efforts of Miss
Barrett and Gary Macklin to convince her that
flying was safe. The entire group burst into
hearty laughter and the director leaned back
to speak to Miss Barrett.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s one of the best bits of natural
comedy I&#8217;ve seen in years,&#8221; Jane heard him say.</p>

<p>The picture swung into the air action which
had been taken that morning, showing the departure
of the tri-motor. Then Jane saw the
black plane which she had piloted bearing
down on the transport and she leaned forward
in her chair. This was her part of the picture.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_203'></a>203</span>Her mouth felt dry and her brow was hot as
she watched the black plane dart toward the
unsuspecting tri-motor.</p>

<p>Smoke and flame shot from the gun on her
plane as she maneuvered to force the transport
down. The camera range had been too long
to get a glimpse of Jane&#8217;s face and reveal that
a girl was flying the plane, but her scarf, which
had been wound around her head, trailed over
the edge of the cockpit, whipping in the wind.</p>

<p>The director turned to an assistant. &#8220;Make
a note that when we take the close-up shots in
the studio there must be a scarf tied to the helmet
of the pilot of the bandit plane.&#8221;</p>

<p>Out of the clouds dropped Charlie Fischer
in the army plane, roaring down upon Jane and
the black ship. For the next few minutes Jane
was almost breathless as she watched the maneuvers
in the air. It was more thrilling than
she had dared to imagine, and the cameras had
caught every twist and turn of the plane.
Then came the last dive by Charlie and the puff
of smoke from the black biplane, which fell
away in a twisting dive.</p>

<p>Jane, watching intently, saw flames lick out
of the fuselage and seconds later she catapulted
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_204'></a>204</span>from the burning plane. The cameras, following
the blazing ship, failed to show her
chute open, but they kept the focus on the
plane until it smashed into the ground, a flaming
mass of wreckage.</p>

<p>The film sputtered out of the projector and
the lights in the ballroom came on. Director
James turned to Jane and Charlie.</p>

<p>&#8220;Congratulations on some exceptionally
fine flying,&#8221; he said. Then, aiming his question
at Jane, he asked, &#8220;How would you like
to come to Hollywood? I&#8217;m sure we could
find some small roles for a girl who has your
coolness and nerve.&#8221;</p>

<p>Jane shook her head firmly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Once was enough. I&#8217;ve had all of the
movie experience I want.&#8221;</p>

<div>
<a id='ch22'></a>
<p class='line mt3ch center'><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_205'></a>205</span><span class='sc'>Chapter Twenty-two</span></p>
<p class='line mb2ch center'><i>Promotion for Jane</i></p>
</div>

<p><span class='sc'>&#8220;What&#8217;s</span> this I hear about your turning down
an offer to go to Hollywood?&#8221; demanded Sue
when she reached Mrs. Murphy&#8217;s the next
morning after a night flight from Chicago.</p>

<p>&#8220;Did you really do that?&#8221; asked Grace, who
had just arrived.</p>

<p>Jane smiled at their insistent questions.</p>

<p>&#8220;I did something like it,&#8221; she confessed.
&#8220;At least I recall that Mr. James mentioned
something about going to Hollywood. He
said he thought he could find work there for
me in minor parts.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And you turned that down?&#8221; gasped Sue.</p>

<p>&#8220;I certainly did. I&#8217;m no actress and I know
it. Perhaps I could get by for a time on my
ability to do aviation scenes, but that wouldn&#8217;t
last long and then I&#8217;d be looking for a job.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But think of all the romance of going to
Hollywood,&#8221; Sue insisted.</p>

<p>&#8220;There wouldn&#8217;t be much romance in going
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_206'></a>206</span>hungry,&#8221; replied Jane. &#8220;I&#8217;m satisfied.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I think you&#8217;re smart,&#8221; put in Grace. &#8220;In
Chicago the last trip, I heard that with business
picking up, the line was going to put on
more girls. That means Miss Comstock will
need an assistant and I wouldn&#8217;t be a bit surprised
if you were appointed.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d like that if I could keep on flying,&#8221; said
Jane, &#8220;but why do you think I have a chance?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Easy,&#8221; smiled Grace. &#8220;For one thing,
you&#8217;re the best-known stewardess on the line.
You&#8217;ve got a pleasing personality, all of the
girls like you, and you certainly know your
work. What more is needed?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nothing,&#8221; confessed Jane, &#8220;but your
specifications don&#8217;t fit me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Just wait and see,&#8221; predicted Grace.</p>

<p>The motion picture company remained at
Cheyenne the rest of the week, but the shots did
not require extras although the girls often saw
members of the company at the airport.</p>

<p>&#8220;There go my hopes of a film career,&#8221;
smiled Sue a little ruefully, as she watched the
director, and the leading man and lady board a
westbound plane Sunday morning. &#8220;Guess I
wasn&#8217;t cut out for an actress after all.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_207'></a>207</span>&#8220;But you&#8217;re in the picture as an extra, like the
rest of us,&#8221; Alice consoled her.</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll be lucky if they don&#8217;t decide to
eliminate the scenes we&#8217;re in,&#8221; said Grace
cheerfully. &#8220;Of course I&#8217;ve written my folks
all about the picture and they&#8217;ll need a microscope
to find me.&#8221;</p>

<p>During the next week word came out from
Chicago that six more girls were being recruited
and would be sent to Cheyenne to take
the training course. Soon after that, Miss
Comstock summoned Jane to her office.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ve heard the service is to be enlarged?&#8221;
she asked and Jane nodded.</p>

<p>&#8220;It will mean considerable additional work
in training these girls, while I am supervising
the regular routine,&#8221; she went on. &#8220;I have
asked the company for an assistant and they
have given me permission to select one of the
girls in the ranks.&#8221; She paused and Jane&#8217;s
heart leaped hopefully.</p>

<p>&#8220;I should like to have you help me,&#8221; went
on Miss Comstock and Jane felt her face flushing.
&#8220;Your salary will be advanced to $140 a
month, but at present I would prefer that none
of the other girls know about this salary arrangement.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_208'></a>208</span>What do you think about it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m delighted,&#8221; said Jane. &#8220;Of course I&#8217;ll
be glad to do anything that I can, but I don&#8217;t
want to go out of active flying altogether.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You won&#8217;t,&#8221; promised the chief stewardess.
&#8220;After these girls are trained, you&#8217;ll go back
on the <i>Coast to Coast</i>. I&#8217;m going to take you
off regular assignment next Sunday for the
girls will arrive early Monday morning. I
shall plan to turn over most of the work in the
classroom and the commissary to you.&#8221;</p>

<p>When Jane told her companions of the good
news, they were almost as pleased as she.</p>

<p>&#8220;I wonder who is going to get your place on
the <i>Coast to Coast?</i>&#8221; mused Sue.</p>

<p>&#8220;You are, my dear. I saw Miss Comstock
making out your transfer card just as I left.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then you&#8217;ll have to watch your laurels,&#8221;
warned Sue, &#8220;for I&#8217;ve always wanted the <i>Coast
to Coast</i> and I&#8217;ll do my best to make such a fine
record they&#8217;ll decide to keep me on that run.
Most of the celebrities pick the <i>Coast to Coast</i>.
It&#8217;s got the fastest and most convenient
schedule.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And the prettiest stewardesses,&#8221; added
Alice.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_209'></a>209</span>The new girls arrived at 9:30 o&#8217;clock Monday
morning and Miss Comstock greeted them.
They were all from Chicago hospitals, pretty,
as well as efficient. Jane catalogued them
mentally, looking for the possible troublemakers,
for after the departure of Mattie Clark,
the routine had been pleasant and they wanted
to keep things that way. None of the new girls
appeared to be inclined toward a &#8220;know-it-all&#8221;
attitude, for which Jane was grateful.</p>

<p>Miss Comstock introduced her and turned
over the routine of helping the girls find rooms.
Jane knew Cheyenne so well by now, that she
was in an excellent position to advise them, and
immediately after lunch they plunged into the
routine of classes, which was to prepare the
newcomers for permanent positions in the
service.</p>

<p>The girls were eager and alert and Jane
found the class work pleasant. There was
nothing of the nervousness and drudgery about
it that she had feared.</p>

<p>When it came time for Miss Comstock to
put the girls through the final examinations,
they passed with flying colors, much to the
credit of their young instructor.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_210'></a>210</span>Some weeks later big news sped along the
line. New planes were being made in the company&#8217;s
plant at Tacoma. The old tri-motors
which had braved the elements through winter
and summer for four years were to be retired.
The new ships would have two engines, of 600
horsepower each, and would speed along at
180 to 190 miles an hour, with a top speed of
210.</p>

<p>Jane asked Charlie Fischer about the planes,
but Charlie professed to be in almost complete
ignorance.</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve got to go to school and learn how to
handle them,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I&#8217;m starting for Tacoma
tomorrow night. I hear they&#8217;re all metal
with the latest do-dads the inventors can stick
on them. Pretty soon we&#8217;ll have to have an
expert along to tell the pilot what to do.&#8221;</p>

<p>All of the ace pilots of the line were called
to Tacoma at various intervals to see the new
planes. Charlie returned enthusiastic.</p>

<p>&#8220;They&#8217;re the greatest ships ever built,&#8221; he
told Jane and Sue, the first time he saw them
after his return. &#8220;Why we&#8217;ll be able to outrun
the lightning. They carry ten passengers,
two pilots and a stewardess, although I don&#8217;t
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_211'></a>211</span>know why they want the latter tagging along.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Seems to me, Charlie,&#8221; interrupted Sue,
&#8220;that once or twice you&#8217;ve been mighty glad to
have a stewardess on the ship.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Must have been some other fellow,&#8221;
grinned Charlie. &#8220;Just wait until you see your
pantry. The whole thing&#8217;s done in the latest
stainless metal. My instrument board looks
like an inventor&#8217;s paradise, but I guess I&#8217;ll be
able to figure out what all of the gauges and
dials are for.&#8221;</p>

<p>Interest in the new planes ran high and the
first test flight across the entire system was set
for October 2nd. According to the tentative
schedule, they would clip at least eight hours
off the coast to coast time.</p>

<p>Jane hoped that she would get the first assignment,
for she was back in active service, but
Grace drew the coveted slip, which gave her
the right to care for the passengers on the initial
flight of the new queen of the air.</p>

<p>They watched the progress of the swift craft
from the moment it left the Golden Gate. As
many of the Cheyenne crew as possible
grouped about the radio in the communications
office. With a favoring tail wind, the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_212'></a>212</span>pilots west of Cheyenne kept the average at
better than 190 miles an hour, including stops.
It was fast enough to make them almost dizzy.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll bet I never get a deep breath from here
to Chicago,&#8221; smiled Grace, as the silver monoplane
settled down on the Cheyenne field.</p>

<p>The new craft was a thing of beauty, all
metal, with one low wing. The propellers
were set ahead of the wing and the wheels
folded into the body when it was in flight.
The fuselage with the pilots&#8217; cockpit and cabin
for the passengers was like the body of a wasp,
long and gracefully stream-lined to reduce
wind resistance.</p>

<p>Jane and Sue accompanied Grace to the
plane, anxious to see what the interior was like.
It was not as roomy as the hulking tri-motors,
but the seats were more comfortable and the
pantry which the stewardess used was complete
to the latest detail. The lights were soft
and easily adjustable. Each passenger could
control the ventilation of the individual windows.
The interior was in black and brown,
pleasingly harmonious.</p>

<p>There was a full passenger list, and Grace
was busy checking over the list and making
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_213'></a>213</span>sure the necessary supplies were aboard. Then
the sleek craft was away, Jane and Sue waving,
as the monoplane rolled out of the hangar.
Grace waved back as the night swallowed the
plane.</p>

<p>For two hours Jane and Sue remained at the
field, listening to reports of the speeding ship,
which was setting a new record for air passenger
travel in the United States.</p>

<p>&#8220;What fun it would be aloft tonight,&#8221; said
Sue a bit sadly, &#8220;and to know that you were
setting a new speed record.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We shouldn&#8217;t begrudge Grace that trip,&#8221;
Jane replied. &#8220;We&#8217;ve had plenty of good
things since we joined the service.&#8221;</p>

<p>Before winter set in, the entire fleet of new
planes was operating on the transcontinental
line and the sturdy old tri-motors were wheeled
into the hangars where dust soon stood thick
on the valiant wings.</p>

<p>Winter flying was to be a new experience
for the girls, and they were issued trimly
tailored coats, heavily lined. Fortunately the
new planes were well insulated and there was
a splendid electric heating system.</p>

<p>Extreme cold failed to slow up the schedules,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_214'></a>214</span>the planes stopping only for snow, which
swirled down from the peaks of the Rockies.
Christmas eve found Jane roaring toward Chicago
on the <i>Coast to Coast</i>, but she had planned
for it and brought a tiny Christmas tree aboard
at Cheyenne. There were only eight passengers
aboard and she had shopped in the
dime store for small gifts which would be appropriate
for almost any group. She copied
the names from the passenger list on gift tags
and then carried the tree and her armful of
presents to the front of the cabin, placing them
in the two forward chairs.</p>

<p>The passengers were delighted, for Christmas
eve away from home, even at 5,000 feet in
the air and speeding along at 180 miles an hour,
could be a little dreary.</p>

<p>Jane was gay, and her good humor cheered
up her passengers. One by one she called their
names and they opened their presents with evident
curiosity and enthusiasm. There was a
nice handkerchief for the elderly woman who
was hurrying to Chicago, a tube of shaving-cream
for the clean-shaven New York traveling
man, and a picture book for the little girl
of seven who was traveling with her mother.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_215'></a>215</span>Gifts for the other passengers were appropriate.
Then Jane opened a basket of popcorn
balls she had made at Mrs. Murphy&#8217;s and
a box of delicious home-made candy. All in
all, it was as gay and pleasant as Christmas eve
could be away from home.</p>

<p>With the turn into the new year, winter descended
on the Rockies in all its fury. Blizzards
raged for days and the passenger schedules
were practically abandoned. Whenever
the storm let up, the planes, with only the pilots
and the mail aboard, dashed across the continental
divide, but for more than a week, Jane
and her companions remained snowbound at
Cheyenne.</p>

<p>Then reports of sickness and misery in isolated
mountain towns began to creep in. Doctors
were running short of supplies in villages
where the flu had appeared. Unless the blizzards
abated soon, there would be serious
trouble.</p>

<p>Jane was scheduled to go out on the <i>Coast
to Coast</i>, coming through from the west for the
first time in three days. The plane was hours
late and she reported at the field just as the
early January night closed down. Miss Comstock
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_216'></a>216</span>was in the operations room. So was Slim
Bollei, one of the veteran pilots.</p>

<p>&#8220;You might as well go home, Jane,&#8221; said
Miss Comstock. &#8220;I phoned, but you had
started for the field. It&#8217;s snowing west of here
and the <i>Coast to Coast</i> won&#8217;t get out of Rock
Springs before dawn.&#8221;</p>

<p>Slim Bollei, who had been looking out the
window, shrugged his shoulders.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re optimistic,&#8221; he grinned. &#8220;It&#8217;s
snowing thicker and harder than at any time
this winter.&#8221;</p>

<p>The weather had turned bitter cold with the
wind lashing around the big hangar in a chilling
overture.</p>

<p>When Jane started back to the city, she
found that the field car which had brought her
was stalled. She telephoned for a taxi, but was
informed that no machine would be available
for at least an hour, so she made herself comfortable
in the waiting room which adjoined
the office of the night operations chief.</p>

<p>Sue called to learn if they were going to
try to get the <i>Coast to Coast</i> through and Jane
informed her that she was marooned at the
field.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_217'></a>217</span>&#8220;Maybe I&#8217;ll be home by morning,&#8221; she concluded
hopefully.</p>

<p>It was half an hour later when the phone on
the night chief&#8217;s desk rang. Jane was near
enough to catch most of the conversation for
the man on the other end of the wire was shouting.</p>

<p>&#8220;Sure, I know there&#8217;s trouble,&#8221; the night
chief said, &#8220;but we aren&#8217;t moving any of our
mail planes. It would be suicide to attempt
to fly tonight.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s the matter?&#8221; asked Slim Bollei.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s the governor at Laramie,&#8221; replied the
night chief. &#8220;There&#8217;s been a bad outbreak of
diphtheria at Lytton, a village up against the
Montana line in the country that God forgot.
The doctor there is out of serum and a couple
of the youngsters are desperately ill. There&#8217;s
plenty of serum here and the governor wants
us to get a plane through.&#8221;</p>

<p>The night chief turned back to the telephone.</p>

<p>&#8220;But I tell you, governor, it can&#8217;t be done.
You can&#8217;t see a hundred feet through this storm
and the temperature&#8217;s down to five below zero
and dropping fast.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_218'></a>218</span>&#8220;Wait a minute,&#8221; cut in Slim Bollei. &#8220;Find
out what&#8217;s the least possible time the serum can
be used and do any good.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;They&#8217;ve got to have it before tomorrow
night,&#8221; said the night chief when the governor&#8217;s
reply came to him. &#8220;Everything else that&#8217;s
tried to get to Lytton has failed. It&#8217;s a plane
or nothing at all.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Tell him we&#8217;ll get through some way,&#8221;
snapped Slim. &#8220;We can&#8217;t let kids die without
trying.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But we can&#8217;t afford to wreck one of the
new ships,&#8221; protested the night chief.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll take one of the old tri-motors. Tell the
governor we&#8217;ll get through.&#8221;</p>

<p>The flyer turned and walked toward the
radio room.</p>

<p>&#8220;Get Chicago,&#8221; he snapped, &#8220;and have them
put the operations chief on the wire.&#8221;</p>

<p>Less than a minute later Slim Bollei poured
his story over the short wave radio and into the
ears of the operations chief at Chicago. He
wanted one of the old tri-motors and he got it
with the chief&#8217;s blessing. After that he left
on the run to route out a ground crew to get
the plane ready for the flight.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_219'></a>219</span>Miss Comstock, who had listened gravely,
turned to Jane.</p>

<p>&#8220;Slim can&#8217;t go alone,&#8221; she said. &#8220;A nurse
will be needed there. I&#8217;m going. You take
charge here.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But you&#8217;re needed more than I am,&#8221; protested
Jane. &#8220;Let me go.&#8221;</p>

<p>Miss Comstock shook her head.</p>

<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s too much danger. Slim and I will
go.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;One nurse won&#8217;t be enough,&#8221; insisted Jane.
&#8220;Think what two of us could do, think what it
will mean to those youngsters.&#8221;</p>

<p>Miss Comstock smiled. &#8220;You win, Jane.
We&#8217;ll both go.&#8221;</p>

<p>Outside the shadowy bulk of one of the
tri-motors was being wheeled into the hangar.
As soon as there was the slightest break in the
storm, they would be away on their errand of
mercy.</p>

<div>

<p class='line mt3ch center'><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_220'></a>220</span><span class='sc'>Chapter Twenty-three</span></p>
<p class='line mb2ch center'><i>White Madness</i></p>
</div>

<p><span class='sc'>Miss Comstock</span>, with Jane at her heels, hurried
into the commissary. Supplies must be
made ready and food placed aboard the tri-motor.
Out in the hangar a crew worked
desperately over the big plane, tuning up the
motors and checking in the gas and oil.</p>

<p>Slim Bollei, in a sheepskin, appeared to be
everywhere, orders cracking from his thin lips.</p>

<p>In half an hour Jane and the chief stewardess
had two large hampers ready, one filled with
medical supplies and bandages and the other
containing food. There was more than a
chance that they would be forced down and
food might become very much of a necessity.</p>

<p>A car struggled through the storm, bringing
the serum out from the city, and Slim Bollei
returned to the operations office.</p>

<p>&#8220;Everything&#8217;s ready,&#8221; he informed the
night chief. &#8220;How&#8217;s the weather?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not so good. It&#8217;s still snowing hard in the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_221'></a>221</span>mountains and the mercury is eight below now,
but it won&#8217;t drop much further.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll wait another hour and see if we can
get away then,&#8221; decided Slim.</p>

<p>Jane and Miss Comstock sat down in the
waiting room, drawing their coats around
them, for at eight below zero the heating plant
was functioning none too well.</p>

<p>The pilot came in with two fleece-lined
coats.</p>

<p>&#8220;Better put these on,&#8221; he advised. &#8220;There
won&#8217;t be much heat in the cabin and I don&#8217;t
want to drop down at Lytton with a couple of
frozen stewardesses on my hands.&#8221;</p>

<p>They accepted the coats gratefully and
waited for the next reports on the storm.</p>

<p>It was dismal waiting there, with the wind
howling around the hangar and the snow driving
against the windows. At midnight it was
still storming hard and they delayed their departure
another hour. But the storm held on
and the sky was greying before Slim Bollei decided
to make the attempt.</p>

<p>The motors of the huge biplane roared
lustily in spite of the cold, the hampers and the
precious serum were placed aboard, parachutes
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_222'></a>222</span>were adjusted under their coats and the
trio, the chief pilot and the two stewardesses,
struggled out to the plane.</p>

<p>The cabin was cold and it would take some
time before heat from the motors warmed it.
Miss Comstock and Jane kept moving about
and looking out at the storm. It was still snowing,
but the fall was not as thick as it had been
during the night. Reports from the west indicated
the end of the blizzard was near.</p>

<p>Slim Bollei came back into the main
cabin.</p>

<p>&#8220;All ready?&#8221; he asked.</p>

<p>Miss Comstock nodded.</p>

<p>&#8220;See that your chute packs don&#8217;t foul. If I
signal three times on your light you&#8217;ll know
we&#8217;re in trouble. Four sharp flashes will mean
you&#8217;ve got to unload.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What about yourself?&#8221; demanded the chief
stewardess.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll get along all right,&#8221; said Slim. &#8220;You
get out of the cabin if I signal for a jump.&#8221;</p>

<p>The radio operator ran out with the final
weather report and the tractor rolled the big
doors away. The biplane quivered as the full
strength of the wind whistled through the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_223'></a>223</span>hangar. Then the ship rolled ahead, flame
spitting from the three long exhausts. The
runways had been swept clear of snow by the
wind and Slim Bollei opened the throttle. In
no time at all they were in the air, turning
north for the 160-mile flight to Lytton.</p>

<p>With a quartering wind from the Rockies,
the plane pitched badly and Miss Comstock
and Jane fastened their safety belts. Even then
they were thrown around sharply.</p>

<p>The cabin warmed only slightly, for the
older ships had been poorly insulated. Jane
beat her hand together to keep the circulation
flowing. The air speed indicator hovered
around the 90 mile an hour mark. At that rate
it would take them nearly two hours to make
the trip. The ground disappeared in the drifting
haze of snow and Jane knew the pilot was
flying blind. She was glad that Slim was rated
one of the best flyers on the system, for he
would have need of every ounce of the skill in
his capable hands.</p>

<p>For an hour they bored through the storm.
Then the middle motor started to sputter and
the light flashed three times. They unfastened
their safety belts and stood in the aisle.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_224'></a>224</span>&#8220;I&#8217;m going ahead to see what&#8217;s wrong,&#8221; said
Miss Comstock.</p>

<p>She hurried forward and Jane listened intently
to the uneven firing of the motor.</p>

<p>When Miss Comstock returned Jane could
see that the chief stewardess was worried.</p>

<p>&#8220;Slim says the motor seems to be freezing
up. It&#8217;s only a question of time before it will
quit altogether.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Does that mean we&#8217;ll have to try for a landing?&#8221;
asked Jane.</p>

<p>&#8220;He thinks he can keep going on the wing
motors. He&#8217;s going to try but he said to be
ready to jump if one of them stops.&#8221;</p>

<p>Standing in the aisle of the cold cabin, with
the wind rocking the plane and the snow hiding
the ground, Jane felt a chilling of her heart that
was caused by something beside the sub-zero
winter. The serum they carried was so desperately
needed in the isolated town. Lives
of children depended on the success of their
trip. They must win through; the wing
motors must continue their rhythmic beating.</p>

<p>Five minutes later the center motor quit firing
altogether and the wing engines growled as
the added burden came upon them. The wind
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_225'></a>225</span>seemed to have slackened slightly, but the
mantle of snow still enfolded them in its fleecy
whiteness.</p>

<p>The minutes crept on endlessly. They must
be nearing the village if the pilot&#8217;s calculations
were correct and the wind had not drifted them
too far off their course.</p>

<p>Jane went to one of the windows and peered
down. There was only the snow and the
wind swirling it below them. Then they
started down, feeling their way through the
blizzard.</p>

<p>It was tricky work, a task that required the
hand of a master pilot, for at any moment they
might smash down out of the sky in a crash
landing.</p>

<p>With nerves taut, the stewardesses watched
the needle of the altimeter. The light flashed
three times. It was the warning of trouble
ahead.</p>

<p>The plane lurched upward and a resounding
shock rocked the big craft. Jane caught a
glimpse of something black and rugged underneath
the left wing. Miss Comstock cried out
in alarm.</p>

<p>&#8220;The landing gear&#8217;s smashed,&#8221; she shouted.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_226'></a>226</span>&#8220;We must have struck a rock ridge,&#8221; replied
Jane.</p>

<p>They zoomed upward and the light flashed
four times. That was the signal to jump. Jane
looked at Miss Comstock. The chief stewardess
shook her head.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not jumping,&#8221; she cried.</p>

<p>&#8220;Neither am I,&#8221; replied Jane, hurrying
ahead to the pilot&#8217;s cockpit.</p>

<p>Slim Bollei was clinging to his controls.</p>

<p>&#8220;Jump,&#8221; he yelled. &#8220;We&#8217;ve washed out
the landing gear.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re not jumping,&#8221; Jane told him firmly.
&#8220;If the storm will only clear you may be able
to skid in for a landing on the snow.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s what I&#8217;m hoping for, but I can&#8217;t stay
up here forever.&#8221;</p>

<p>Jane remained in the forward cockpit while
the pilot sought a break in the storm which
would enable him to get his bearings and land.
For fifteen minutes they cruised in great
circles.</p>

<p>&#8220;The storm&#8217;s breaking away,&#8221; cried Jane.</p>

<p>Slim nodded hopefully. It did seem as
though the snow was thinning. For another
fifteen minutes the motors droned steadily and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_227'></a>227</span>at the end of that time, the snow lessened to a
fine cloud. Objects on the ground came into
view. &#8220;There&#8217;s a village!&#8221; cried Jane, pointing
to the right.</p>

<p>Slim Bollei swung the tri-motor in a gentle
circle, for he lacked the power for steep climbs
and banks. As the plane roared over the snowbound
town, men appeared, waving their arms
frantically.</p>

<p>&#8220;I guess that&#8217;s the place,&#8221; grinned Slim.
&#8220;It&#8217;s the only town within thirty miles. Now
we&#8217;ve got to find a place where we can do a
little skiing.&#8221;</p>

<p>Beyond the village he found a field nearly
half a mile long. It was sheltered in a valley
with what wind still remained sweeping the
length of the field.</p>

<p>&#8220;Get back in the cabin and hang on,&#8221;
shouted the pilot. &#8220;I&#8217;m going to cut the
motors and see what kind of a snowbird this is.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re starting down,&#8221; Jane told Miss
Comstock when she returned to the cabin.</p>

<p>The plane tilted forward and the motors
eased down to a whisper. The snow-covered
ground leaped toward them, then seemed to
pause in its mad rush as the biplane leveled out
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_228'></a>228</span>there was a sharp bump, the sound of tearing
wood and fabric, and a series of jolting shocks
before the tri-motor came to rest with its nose
in a deep drift.</p>

<p>Slim Bollei staggered back into the cabin, a
deep gash over his right eye.</p>

<p>&#8220;Get the serum out of here. The gas tanks
have given way and the fuel may explode any
second.&#8221;</p>

<p>Jane clutched the package of precious serum
and threw open the cabin door. Miss Comstock
came after her, tugging the hamper
loaded with medical supplies while Slim carried
the hamper of food. The snow was eighteen
inches deep, and they floundered through it,
gasping for breath. They stopped a hundred
yards away from the big plane and Slim eyed
it ruefully.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s a good job for a salvage crew,&#8221; he
said, &#8220;but I guess the line won&#8217;t kick a whole
lot. That ship paid for itself many a time.&#8221;</p>

<p>Strangely enough, even with the fuel
flowing out of the split gas tanks, the big craft
did not take fire and the flyer and the stewardesses
turned to greet the villagers, who were
hurrying to meet them.</p>

<p class='line mb2ch center'><i>Dangerous Passengers</i></p>
</div>

<p><span class='sc'>Miss Comstock</span> and Jane remained in the village
two days, ministering to the needs of the
stricken children and playing first assistant to
the over-worked village doctor. Then another
Federated Airways plane, one of the old
tri-motors, dropped down on them and
whisked them back to Cheyenne. From the
governor came a personal note of appreciation
for what they had done.</p>

<p>After that the winter tapered off. The
storms were less severe and the flying schedules
were maintained, almost without interruption.
Jane and her companions found their routine
duties pleasant, for no two days were alike.
The weather varied, passengers changed and
there was always the element of the unexpectd
injecting itself into their work.</p>

<p>Spring arrived in a shroud of rain and fog,
but with the improvement of the radio beacons,
the planes were seldom delayed. The end of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_230'></a>230</span>their first year as stewardesses neared and it was
late in May when Jane, aboard the eastbound
<i>Coast to Coast Limited</i>, swooped down on the
field at Omaha.</p>

<p>To her surprise, the first passenger to step
aboard was Miss Hardy, the supervisor of
nurses at Good Samaritan. Jane was genuinely
glad to see her, for it had been through Miss
Hardy she had received the opportunity to
join the stewardess service.</p>

<p>The <i>Coast to Coast</i> was five minutes ahead
of schedule and Jane and the supervisor had a
chance to visit. Miss Hardy explained that
she was going to Chicago for a part of her vacation
and had finally managed to make up her
mind to fly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Perhaps I&#8217;d better say my brother convinced
me,&#8221; she smiled. &#8220;I&#8217;ve been in Omaha
a week. He&#8217;s a regular aviation fan and comes
out to the field two or three times a week to
watch the night planes come in. After he
dragged me along, I began to feel that I wasn&#8217;t
afraid to make the trip.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll enjoy every minute of it,&#8221; Jane assured
her, &#8220;and I&#8217;m especially delighted that
your first trip is with me. Slim Bollei, one of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_231'></a>231</span>the most skilled pilots on the line, is at the controls
today. That means you&#8217;ll have a smooth,
comfortable trip. Once in a while a cross wind
gives the passengers a little trouble, but travel
is unusually comfortable today.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ve certainly attracted national attention,&#8221;
said Miss Hardy. &#8220;I&#8217;ve read of your
exploits on several occasions, once when the
bandit plane tried to abduct that wealthy New
York woman and again when you flew to some
small town with a supply of much needed
serum.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It wasn&#8217;t done for publicity&#8217;s sake,&#8221; said
Jane, &#8220;but the public and the newspapers
aren&#8217;t used to stewardesses on planes and when
they do anything out of the ordinary, that&#8217;s
news.&#8221;</p>

<p>Departure time came and Jane saw that Miss
Hardy was settled comfortably, in a chair next
to a window, and halfway back on the right
side of the plane. Miss Hardy looked older
and her eyes appeared tired. She must have
had a hard year with the new classes of girls
at Good Samaritan, thought Jane.</p>

<p>They roared off the field, flashed over the
muddy Missouri, and then struck out across
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_232'></a>232</span>the rolling farm land of western Iowa. The
country was fresh, with the green of the pastures
contrasting sharply against the black of
the corn fields, in which the first spears of the
new stalks were starting to peep through the
top soil.</p>

<p>Several times on their swift flight over Iowa,
Jane stopped to talk with Miss Hardy, who appeared
to be enjoying the trip immensely. It
was a non-stop hop from Omaha that afternoon
and almost before they knew it, the graceful
craft was settling down on the Chicago
field.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve enjoyed the trip so much I&#8217;m going in
and make my reservation for the return flight,&#8221;
said Miss Hardy, as Jane helped her out of the
plane.</p>

<p>&#8220;Then I&#8217;ll look forward to having you
booked on my plane,&#8221; said Jane. &#8220;Thanks so
much for your recommendation last year. It
helped a great deal in getting jobs for Sue and
me.&#8221;</p>

<p>Sue arrived the next morning on the slower
<i>Night Flyer</i> and found that she was booked out
that night for the return to Cheyenne. Business
eastbound had been heavier than the westbound
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_233'></a>233</span>traffic, and as a result there were more
girls at the Chicago airport than needed. Jane
was assigned to fly back with Sue, resuming her
regular schedule from Cheyenne on the <i>Coast
to Coast</i> on the second day.</p>

<p>When Sue got her passenger list, there were
only four, all of them going through to the
coast.</p>

<p>&#8220;Looks like an easy trip,&#8221; she told Jane.</p>

<p>Two traveling men were the first aboard and
they were followed a few minutes later by a
woman of about forty, who was accompanied
by a curly-haired boy of seven or eight.</p>

<p>Sue nudged Jane sharply.</p>

<p>&#8220;Those people are down as Mrs. Henry
Smith and son, but that boy looks like Jackie
Condon, the famous movie star.&#8221;</p>

<p>Jane looked again. The boy certainly resembled
the lad she had seen on the screen so
many times in the last two years. His salary
was reported to be fabulous, his weekly pay
so large the figures dazzled.</p>

<p>Two minutes before starting time, there
was a jam at the gate and two men, well dressed,
with dark, smooth faces, hurried forward, waving
tickets.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_234'></a>234</span>&#8220;You&#8217;re just in time,&#8221; said Sue, taking their
tickets and assigning them to forward chairs.</p>

<p>They nodded and entered the plane. Jane
standing beside the landing stage saw something
that alarmed her, as the second man
passed. His coat slipped open just as he bent
to go through the door and she caught a glimpse
of a gun in a shoulder holster. Guns were not
unfamiliar sights to the stewardesses, for each
pilot went armed, but a gun on a passenger was
a different thing.</p>

<p>&#8220;What were the names of those men?&#8221; she
asked Sue.</p>

<p>&#8220;Anton Mellotti and Chris Bardo. Why?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The last man, Bardo, is carrying a gun.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;d better tell Charlie Fischer. He&#8217;s
flying us west tonight.&#8221;</p>

<p>They hurried ahead and caught Charlie just
before he climbed into the cockpit.</p>

<p>&#8220;So we&#8217;ve got a gunman aboard,&#8221; said Charlie,
when the girls informed him of what Jane
had seen. &#8220;We&#8217;ll see about that.&#8221;</p>

<p>Charlie entered the cabin and tapped Bardo
on the shoulder. Jane couldn&#8217;t hear what he
said, but when Charlie returned he didn&#8217;t have
the gun.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_235'></a>235</span>&#8220;He flashed a deputy sheriff&#8217;s badge and
there wasn&#8217;t anything I could do,&#8221; explained
Charlie. &#8220;You kids have let your imaginations
run away with you. It&#8217;s time to go.&#8221;</p>

<p>Sue and Jane went aboard and Jane gave
her friend a hand in strapping the passengers
into their seats. Then they sped westward as
though racing to overtake the sun.</p>

<p>Jane picked up a movie magazine from the
pile aboard the ship. On the fifth page was a
large picture of Jackie Condon. Jane looked
at it sharply and then at the boy passenger.
There was no mistake. Sue was right.</p>

<p>She looked ahead at the passengers who had
arrived just before their departure. Mellotti
was heavy set, with black hair and beetling
brows. Bardo was taller, lithe and quick of
action. His eyes, so dark a brown they were
almost black, shone with animation and when
he looked at Jane she felt a queer chill creep
along her spine. There was something sinister
in his manner.</p>

<p>The trip westward was uneventful and they
left Omaha on time. It was near Kearney
when Jane, who had been reading an Omaha
paper, looked up to see one of the passengers
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_236'></a>236</span>standing in the aisle. She started ahead to tell
him that it was against orders when she saw
something glinting dully in his right hand.
Other passengers were raising their hands.</p>

<p>It was Mellotti, gun in hand. Bardo, also
carrying a weapon, was hurrying toward the
pilot&#8217;s cockpit and Jane knew that the suspicion
which had gripped her in Chicago was a
reality. They were abducting the young film
star.</p>

<p class='line mb2ch center'><i>On Desperate Wings</i></p>
</div>

<p><span class='sc'>That</span> night was timeless for Jane. Always she
would remember the stark horror of it as the
plane roared through the darkness with the
gunmen in control.</p>

<p>Mellotti remained in the cabin, guarding the
passengers. Up ahead Bardo forced Charlie
Fischer to swing the plane off the transcontinental
airway. They were flying north.
That was all Jane knew.</p>

<p>The hours slipped away with aching slowness.
Jackie Condon and his mother remained
calm and the traveling men started a card game.
When the sky finally lightened, they were over
a great, flat expanse of country with a chain of
mountains barely visible in the west. Jane
guessed they must be somewhere in Canada,
just east of the Rockies.</p>

<p>Fifteen minutes later the plane landed and
taxied across a weedy field to a lonely road that
wound across the prairie. A truck, laden with
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_238'></a>238</span>barrels of gasoline, was waiting. Jane and the
others were not permitted to leave the cabin
while Bardo forced Charlie Fischer and his co-pilot
to help fill the wing tanks. When that
task was done, Bardo entered the cabin.</p>

<p>&#8220;Get out,&#8221; he told the traveling men.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hey, you can&#8217;t maroon us like this&#8221; the
older one protested.</p>

<p>&#8220;Get out,&#8221; repeated Bardo, his black eyes
snapping, and they hastened to obey.</p>

<p>Jane and Sue started to follow the traveling
men, but Bardo&#8217;s soft voice stopped them.</p>

<p>&#8220;Stay here. We want you to take care of
this youngster. His mother gets off here.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mrs. Condon&#8217;s protests were to no avail and
she was shoved roughly from the plane.</p>

<p>Bardo disappeared up ahead and presently
the motors started. Mellotti locked the door
and the plane swung around for a dash across
the field. Jane&#8217;s face blanched as she saw
Charlie Fischer and the co-pilot standing on the
ground. Bardo was flying the plane. She and
Sue and Jackie Condon were alone with the
kidnapers.</p>

<p>Bardo appeared to be a flyer of above average
ability for he handled the large plane easily.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_239'></a>239</span>They sped westward, climbing over what Jane
was sure were the snow-crested Canadian
Rockies. Then they dropped down the other
side, and a great expanse of water loomed
ahead.</p>

<p>The plane turned northward, skimming over
the coast line. For fully an hour they went on
and then Bardo brought the transport down on
a long shingle of sand. It was an easy landing
and Jane admired his skill.</p>

<p>Moored nearby was a seaplane and in a
clump of trees a hundred yards from the beach
were two cabins. It was an ideal hideaway and
Jane knew that unless a miracle happened, there
was little chance of searching parties finding
them.</p>

<p>The girls and Jackie were ordered to the
larger of the two cabins.</p>

<p>&#8220;You take care of the boy. It&#8217;ll be just too
bad if anything happens to him,&#8221; said Bardo
darkly. They had been joined by a third man,
evidently the pilot of the seaplane. Like the
gunmen who had captured the transport, he
was dark and swarthy.</p>

<p>Jackie was a delightful youngster and Jane
and Sue admired his calm courage.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_240'></a>240</span>&#8220;Of course I was scared,&#8221; he said, &#8220;but I
didn&#8217;t dare let those fellows know. I guess
we&#8217;ll just have to wait until someone comes
along and rescues us.&#8221;</p>

<p>He was brave about it, but Jane knew that
no one was going to come along and rescue
them. They would be held until Jackie&#8217;s
mother paid the ransom demand or<span style='white-space: nowrap'>&#8211;&#8211;</span>. But
Jane couldn&#8217;t think of the other possibility and
she set her mind to working on some plan of
escape.</p>

<p>There was plenty of food in the cabin and
the girls and Jackie were given the freedom of
the beach. That first night Jane couldn&#8217;t sleep
much, turning and tossing as she tried to evolve
some plan of escape. To attempt to flee in
the transport was impossible for she didn&#8217;t
know the first thing about piloting one of the
big ships. But the seaplane. That was different.
Of course she had never flown one,
but it looked like a common biplane only instead
of wheels it had pontoons. Certainly the
operation must be the same.</p>

<p>Jane was up with the dawn. The seaplane
was still moored a few yards from the beach,
the canvas cover shielding the motor.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_241'></a>241</span>Throughout the day she waited, hoping the
men might leave the beach for a few minutes,
but her hopes were unavailing. Night came
and they were locked in the cabin.</p>

<p>When she was sure that no one was within
earshot, Jane told Sue and Jackie what she
hoped to do.</p>

<p>&#8220;If I can get out to the seaplane and get it
started I&#8217;m sure we&#8217;ll be able to get away,&#8221; she
whispered, &#8220;but first we&#8217;ve got to get out of
the cabin.&#8221;</p>

<p>They tried the windows, one by one, and
the third appeared loose. Working quietly
with a kitchen knife they finally slid the window
aside.</p>

<p>The darkness was heavy and Jane slipped
through the window first. Jackie was second
and finally Sue. The lights were out in the
other cabin and they moved swiftly down to
the beach. Little waves lapped the sand.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you think the water&#8217;s deep?&#8221; Sue whispered.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve got to chance it,&#8221; replied Jane. &#8220;The
rowboat&#8217;s padlocked. Here goes.&#8221;</p>

<p>She plunged in boldly. The bottom fell
away gradually and the water was only a little
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_242'></a>242</span>more than waist deep when she reached the
pontoons and pulled herself aboard.</p>

<p>Turning, she called softly to Sue.</p>

<p>&#8220;Wade out with Jackie. It isn&#8217;t deep.&#8221;</p>

<p>A minute later Sue, holding Jackie in her
arms, was beside the seaplane and Jane helped
them aboard.</p>

<p>&#8220;Get into the forward cockpit,&#8221; she said.
&#8220;I&#8217;m going to cast off the mooring line.&#8221;</p>

<p>Once free of the line which held it, the seaplane
started drifting along parallel with the
beach. Jane scrambled back to the pilot&#8217;s
cockpit after pulling the canvas off the motor.
Guardedly she turned on the light over the
dash. Some of the instruments were unfamiliar,
but it was a standard control plane.
Her heart leaped for she knew she would be
able to fly it.</p>

<p>&#8220;What are we going to do now?&#8221; asked Sue.</p>

<p>&#8220;Wait for dawn.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But that will be hours.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We can&#8217;t risk a takeoff in the night,&#8221; replied
Jane. &#8220;Make yourselves as comfortable
as you can. At least we&#8217;re on our way.&#8221;</p>

<p>Through the night they drifted, the current
keeping them just offshore. With the first
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_243'></a>243</span>light, Jane saw they were at least three miles
from the cabins. In a few more minutes their
absence would be discovered.</p>

<p>&#8220;Wake up,&#8221; she told Sue and Jackie.
&#8220;We&#8217;re starting home.&#8221;</p>

<p>Jane primed the motor and snapped the
starter switch. The motor failed to catch and
she primed it again, this time successfully. The
trim plane shook as the propeller spun in the
early morning light.</p>

<p>In order to take off into the wind, Jane was
forced to turn the plane toward the cabin.
Then she opened the throttle, gritted her teeth
and held the stick hard. The seaplane leaped
forward, skimming the tiny waves. It shook
itself free and Jane knew they were a step
nearer home.</p>

<p>They passed close enough to the beach to see
Bardo and his two fellow kidnapers run from
the cabin. Then Jane banked the seaplane and
sped southward. Where they were headed she
could only guess, but they were one their way.</p>

<p>Sue yelled and pointed back. Jane turned.
The kidnapers were getting the transport ready
for flight, but it would be at least another five
minutes before they could get into the air.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_244'></a>244</span>They rounded a rocky headland and Jane
dropped the seaplane low, barely skimming the
water. They would be harder to follow down
low.</p>

<p>The top speed of the seaplane was 110 an
hour and Jane knew that the transport, capable
of almost double that, would soon be upon
them. They must find shelter soon.</p>

<p>Fifteen minutes later the transport, coming
low and fast, roared into view. Not more than
five minutes was between the planes now and
still no village had been sighted. The distance
between the planes was vanishing like magic
when Jane caught sight of a trail of smoke out
to sea. It was a desperate chance but worth it.</p>

<p>Banking the seaplane sharply, she sped away
from the coast with the transport diving at an
angle to cut her off. It was going to be close,
but Jane pushed the throttle wide open and
somehow the little craft found an added ten
miles an hour.</p>

<p>The outlines of the ship appeared. It was
low and rakish and painted grey, but whatever
it was, it looked like a haven. A cry from
Sue drew Jane&#8217;s attention from the pursuing
plane.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_245'></a>245</span>&#8220;The coast guard!&#8221; shouted Sue and Jane&#8217;s
heart leaped. She dove for the ship, waving
frantically. Above her the transport circled,
afraid to follow.</p>

<p>Jane, too elated to worry about the hazard
of landing the seaplane, made an almost perfect
descent and taxied alongside the coast guard
vessel, which had been brought to a halt. Officers
and men lined the rail for it was seldom
that two girls and a boy appeared in a seaplane.</p>

<p>Jane stood up and cupped her hands.</p>

<p>&#8220;Can you take us aboard? We&#8217;ve got Jackie
Condon, the missing film star.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ve what?&#8221; roared the amazed commander.</p>

<p>Jane repeated her message and a boat was
dropped by the destroyer. It came alongside
the seaplane handsomely, took the mooring
line, and towed the plane up to the destroyer.
Jane went aboard and told her story to the
astounded commander. The radio cracked
out the good news that a whole nation had been
waiting to hear. Then followed directions intended
to bring the apprehension of Bardo and
his band of kidnapers.</p>

<p>The destroyer, en route to Alaska, turned
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_246'></a>246</span>about and with funnels trailing heavy ribbons
of oily smoke, sped toward Seattle under
forced draft. Jane and Sue looked over the
rail at the mountainous coast line of British
Columbia. In less than a week, they would be
back on the transcontinental, settling into their
routine work.</p>

<p>&#8220;Know what day this is?&#8221; asked Jane.</p>

<p>&#8220;Our first anniversary,&#8221; smiled Sue. &#8220;We
joined the airways just a year ago. Think how
much has happened?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Just think how much more can happen in
the coming year,&#8221; replied Jane, wondering
vaguely what new adventure might be ahead
of them.</p>
